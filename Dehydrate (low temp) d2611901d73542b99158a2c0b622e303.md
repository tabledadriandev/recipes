# Dehydrate (low temp)

Applications: Fruit leathers, crisps, powders
Confidence: 80
Corrections: Lower temp, thinner slices, rest in desiccant
Failure modes: Case hardening, staling
Medium: Air
Notes: Target water activity for storage.
Sensory cue: Dry, crisp or leathery as target
Source: In-house
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 45–65
Time range: 4–24 h
Tools used: Dehydrator, racks
Type: Dehydrate

**Principle**

Controlled low-temp dehydration to drive off water while preserving color and aroma.
