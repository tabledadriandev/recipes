Homemade Emulsioner

1. Lecithin Alternatives (for Foaming or Emulsifying)

If you can’t get soy lecithin powder or liquid:
	•	Egg yolk — Natural lecithin source!
(Use a tiny bit of fresh egg yolk blended into your liquid to create emulsions or light foams.)
Example: 1 small egg yolk can emulsify ~100–200 ml liquid.
	•	Sunflower lecithin — Sometimes easier to find in health food stores (marketed for supplements).
Same molecular effect as soy lecithin.
	•	Mustard (especially Dijon) — Contains natural emulsifiers.
(Blend in a tiny bit of Dijon mustard for emulsions — especially vinaigrettes or sauces.)
	•	Aquafaba (chickpea water) — If you whip chickpea cooking water, it foams beautifully because of its protein content.
Great for vegan foams.

2. Soy Protein Alternatives (for Foams, Light Structure)

If you can’t find isolated soy protein:
	•	Pea protein powder — Available in fitness stores, usually plant-based, neutral flavor if you choose “unflavored.”
	•	Chickpea flour (besan) — Rich in protein, can be lightly cooked into liquid to add body (careful: it thickens).
	•	Whey protein isolate (if not strictly plant-based) — Fantastic for structure but adds a little dairy note.
	•	Homemade protein concentrate — Reduce the cooking water from lentils or chickpeas; this “broth” becomes a natural protein source.

How to Procure Them Creatively
	•	Ask pharmacists — Sometimes lecithin (especially sunflower lecithin) is sold for supplement purposes, not cooking.
	•	Look in baby food sections — Some baby formulas and thickeners contain lecithin or soy proteins.
	•	Fitness shops — Pea protein and unflavored protein powders are usually easy to find there.
	•	Asian markets — Often have soy products, including soy protein or soy flour, which can be adapted.
