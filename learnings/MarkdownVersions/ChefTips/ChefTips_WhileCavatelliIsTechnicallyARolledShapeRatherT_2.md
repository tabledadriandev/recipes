## The Insight

CAVATECLI 
While cavatelli is technically a rolled shape rather than a sheeted one, I’ve kept it in 
the basic sheeting chapter because it’s made with any one of the twenty-five master 
doughs, in contrast with a rolled dough such as the gnocchi or gnudi. 
You'll need a gnocchi board, sometimes called a cavatelli board, to get the 
distinctive grooves that are a trademark of this shape. The good news is that one can 
be had for less than $10 at many kitchen stores or online. Alternatively, you can use a 
silicone sushi mat to make the grooves—also an economical and practical solution. 
Cavatelli is one of the easier shapes to make without a machine, should you wish 
to enjoy a day of true pasta fatta a mano, or “pasta made by hand.” 
The grooved nature of cavatelli makes it a good candidate for thicker sauces, such 
as Golden Milk Ragu (page 236). MAKES 4 SERVINGS

1 batch dough (your choice of color) 
Flour (and semolina, if
