Brush the mold thoroughly with melted butter, twice.Knead in the butter. As soon as it is fully incorporated,  
briefly knead in the sultanas. Fit the stand mixer with a dough hook and add the flour, yeast, salt, sugar (ensuring the yeast does not come into contact with the salt or sugar), egg, milk, and sourdough starter, if using, to the bowl. Knead at low speed until the mixture pulls away from the sides.  
Arrange the whole almonds around the bottom of the mold  
and chill so they are firmly set in the butter.

• Briefly soak the almonds in boiling water to prevent them burning  
during baking. This also ensures they stick to the kougelhopf.• If the yeast comes into direct contact with the salt and sugar before kneading, 
it will not work efficiently, preventing the dough from rising properly.
