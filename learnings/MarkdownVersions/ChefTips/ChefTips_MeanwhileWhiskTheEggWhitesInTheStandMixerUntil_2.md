Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites in the stand mixer until frothy. 
Add the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream, whisking constantly. 
Squeeze excess water from the gelatin and put in the still-hot saucepan to melt, before whisking into the meringue mixture. While the gelatin soaks, heat the water, sugar,  
and glucose syrup in a saucepan and, when the sugar dissolves, boil to 257° F (125°C). 3 •  2 • 
Spoon the meringue into the pastry bags and pipe long ropes onto one of the baking mats, using the smaller tip, and shells  
onto the other mat, using the larger tip.5 •  The mixture must now be left undisturbed to jellify  
for 12–24  hours at room temperature ( 63°F/17°C),  
to maximize the setting properties of the gelatin.  6 • CHEFS’ NOTES
Filter the egg whites through a fine-mesh strainer before whisking.
