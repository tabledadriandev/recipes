## The Insight

(VII) 
Orlando prefers to plate using his hands, but "when you get to the bottom, 
you gotta pull the tweezers out, unfortunately," he says. 
(IX) 
The dish, like its components, is ephemeral: "We have a pretty strict policy 
at the restaurant," Orlando says. "Once a dish goes on the menu, we 
never put it on again." This one enjoyed a brief tenure, and then, like the 
summer, it was gone. (VI]I) 
Orlando adds cornflowers to the plate. "They grow in and among the 
fennel, and get this sweet anise-y flavor" that works well with the rest 
of the dish, he says. The chef also uses them to break up the plate's 
yellow-black-white color composition. 
(X) 
To finish, Orlando microplanes a miso-cured, smoked, and dried egg yolk 
onto the dish. The rich, smoky yolk connects the sweet, earthy, 
herbaceous flavors on the plate, and its golden hue adds visual depth 
to the dish.
