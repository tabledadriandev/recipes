## The Insight

531
Remove from the heat and whisk in the dissolved tartaric acid  
or lemon juice. Bring to a boil and cook for 2–3  minutes. Add the granulated 
sugar in two or three stages, keeping the mixture at a boil,  
and cook to 221° F–223° F (105° C–106° C), stirring constantly  
so it does not burn. 
Roll the jellies in sugar until coated. Before wrapping them,  
leave them in a cool, well-ventilated place for 24  hours  
so the sugar forms a crust and does not become damp.3 •  2 • 
6 • CHEFS’ NOTES
For firmer or softer jellies, it is necessary to experiment with the cooking temperatures.  
The lower the temperature, the softer the jellies will be. At a higher temperature,  
they will be firmer and can be stored for longer.
