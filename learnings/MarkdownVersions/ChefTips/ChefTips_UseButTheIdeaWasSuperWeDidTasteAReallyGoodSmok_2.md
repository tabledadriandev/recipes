## The Insight

use, but the idea was super. We did taste a really good smoked trout. Not too 
fat, and with a really good smoky flavour. We got the name of the supplier 
(Reykas smokehouse), and perhaps later we can hear the secret behind the 
smoking methods of this place. 
Ten minutes later we arrived at an organic dairy, Bio-bu, where we met 
Susanne Freuler, the laboratory technician there. The products were more 
or less just thin yoghurt. Not interesting. The dairy had only just started 
up and this is why there weren't many products. Perhaps at a later stage 
there will be butter, so we agreed to meet again when the butter is available. 
Apparently Icelandic cows are a completely pure breed, which can be traced 
back to Viking times. They are free-range, and produce about half the milk 
of a Danish cow. Extra high-quality? We'll have to taste more dairy products 
from Iceland. 
Lunch at Hotel Nordica. We meet the head chef, Hakon Mar 6rvarsson, 
and his right-hand man Gunner, who has worked at
