## The Insight

Roux (roo) is a cooked mixture of equal parts by weight of fat and flour.
Fat
The cooking fats employed for making roux are as follows:
Clarified butter is preferred for the finest sauces because of its flavor. The butter is clarified  
(p. 196) because the moisture content of whole butter tends to gelatinize some of the starch 
and makes the roux harder to work.
Margarine is sometimes used in place of butter because of its lower cost. However, its flavor 
is inferior to butter, so it does not make as fine a sauce. The quality of margarine varies from 
brand to brand.
Animal fats, such as chicken fat, beef drippings, and lard, are used when their flavor is 
appropriate to the sauce. Thus, chicken fat can be used for chicken velouté, and beef drip -
pings can be used for beef gravy. When properly used, animal fats can enhance the flavor 
of a sauce.
Vegetable oil and shortening can be used for roux but, because they add no flavor, they are not 
preferred. s ol
