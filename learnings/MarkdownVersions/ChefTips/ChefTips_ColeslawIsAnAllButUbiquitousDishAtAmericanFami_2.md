## The Insight

COLESLAW 
80 BETONY -BRYCE SHUMAN 
Coleslaw is an all-but-ubiquitous dish at American family gatherings. At 
his New York restaurant Betony (which closed in 2016), chef Bryce Shuman felt that 
it was important to plate his version of the humble dish as a circle because the 
shape "is all-encompassing and to me symbolizes family and gathering," he ex­
plains. "This dish is about people coming together." To create his perfect circle, 
Shuman made 2 1/2-inch-long matchsticks from green and white cabbage; orange, 
red, and yellow-streaked dragon carrots; purple and green radishes; chives; and 
broccoli stems. After being tossed in a bit of mustard dressing, they were built into 
a wreath around a metal ring mold. The result remains a pleasing testament to har­
mony, both interpersonal and aesthetic.
