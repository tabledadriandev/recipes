## The Insight

7139To be successful in the food-service industry, cooks need more than the ability to 
prepare delicious, attractive, and nutritious foods. They also must have a talent for organization and efficiency. In every kitchen, a great many tasks must be com-

these tasks are done, they all must come together at one crucial point: service 
time. Only if advance preparation is done thoroughly and systematically can ser -
vice go smoothly.
Good chefs take pride in the thoroughness and quality of their advance 
 preparation, or mise en place (meez-on-plahss). This French term, meaning

to the success of the establishment.
This chapter deals with the basic concepts of mise en place as well as specific 
operations that are normally part of the mise en place.
