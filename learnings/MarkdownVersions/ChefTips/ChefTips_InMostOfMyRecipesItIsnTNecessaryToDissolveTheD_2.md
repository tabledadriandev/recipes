## The Insight

In most of my recipes, it isn’t necessary to dissolve the dried yeast first. These doughs
have a lot of water in them, so the yeast dissolves rapidly in the dough; just sprinkle it on
top of the dough and incorporate it as you mix the dough. There are arguments for
dissolving first, but I prefer the effect on flavor produced by 
dissolving the yeast within
the dough. However, be aware that this doesn’t work in a stiff dough mixed by hand. My
rule of thumb is to predissolve the yeast if the dough has 70 percent or less hydration.
This may seem arbitrary, but it takes into account that mixing by hand is gentler and less
vigorous than mixing by machine. So, for example, if you’re mixing a stiff biga, the dried
yeast needs to be dissolved in water before mixing.
Fresh and Instant Yeast
 If you need to convert a recipe that calls for
fresh yeast, 3 grams fresh yeast = 1 gram instant dried yeast.
