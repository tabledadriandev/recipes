## The Insight

Although this 10-minute task is best done from start to finish without stopping, the
timing doesn’t always allow that. If there is a 5-minute window before I need to go
back to the oven, I’ll take it. To remove this dough from the mixer, I wet my left arm
completely (the sink’s right there), reach inside the mixing bowl to lift a big hunk of
dough, and with the other hand wielding the bread knife, cut the dough cleanly
where it is still attached to the rest—all the while being careful not to let the dough
tear. Put about 7 kilos of dough in each tub (more than that will overflow the bin
because it expands over three times when it rises). Stack the tubs on a rolling cart
next to the baker’s bench. I would usually end up running back and forth: from the
mixer, removing the dough, interrupted by the sound of the timer; to the oven to
check the bread, and if ready, pull it out.
Having left enough ciabatta dough in the mixer for our multigrain bread, add the
grain mixture and incorporate. R
