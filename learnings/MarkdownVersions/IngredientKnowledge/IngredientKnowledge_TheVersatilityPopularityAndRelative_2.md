## The Insight

18533The versatility, popularity, and relatively low cost of poultry items make them ideal 
for all kinds of food-service operations, from high-end restaurants to cafeterias and 
fast-food restaurants. Also, chicken and turkey are popular among diet-conscious 
people because they are lower in fat and cholesterol than other meats. Game birds, such as pheasant, are also increasing in popularity and availability because they are 
now raised domestically by many producers. Farm-raised game birds are similar, in 
many ways, to chicken, so learning techniques for cooking and handling chicken 
teaches you a great deal about handling these other birds as well.

beef and lamb. Because chickens, turkeys, and other poultry are much smaller, they are not cut up in such detail.
However, poultry has its own cooking problems, so it is important to observe 
both the similarities and the differences between meat and poultry.
