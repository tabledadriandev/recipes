## The Insight

follow the recipes here without doing any math, but having a basic awareness of baker’s
percentages will allow you to experiment with different flour mixes, knowledgeably
adjust water in the dough if your flour is more or less absorbent, and simply understand
what you are doing.
UNDERSTANDING BAKER’S PERCENTAGES
With baker’s percentages, all ingredients in a recipe are stated as percentages of the
total flour weight. The total amount of flour is always 100 percent (including a
combination of flours). If the amount of flour in a recipe is 1,000 grams and the
amount of water is 700 grams, water makes up 70 percent of the flour weight.
Likewise, 20 grams of salt in this recipe is 2 percent of the flour weight, and 20
grams of yeast is the same. So this simple recipe could be expressed as 100 percent
70 percent water, 2 percent salt, and 2 percent yeast. This allows recipes to be
scaled up or down easily: whatever the flour weight, the other ingredients can
simply be measured as the expres
