## The Insight

Flavour Group | SULPHUROUS COMPOUNDS | Mustard 179
BLENDING SCIENCE
Mustard’s heat is produced by sulphur-containing isothiocyanates, which, unlike other pungent compounds, 
vaporize at body temperature to have a nose-filling pungency. The complex flavour profile also includes  
pine-like pinene, ground-coffee-like furanmethanethiol, malty, peachy 3-methylbutanal, and popcorn-like 
2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. Nutty, roasted pyrazine flavours are produced by toasting the seeds.
 Parsnips Add a spoonful of wholegrain mustard 
to a creamy parsnip bake.
 Haricot beans Combine English mustard powder 
with molasses and add to a haricot bean casserole.
 Rabbit Add a spoonful of mustard to braised 
rabbit with tarragon. Fish Fry brown mustard seeds in ghee with  
other warming spices, adding tomatoes and onion  
to make a sauce for fried or steamed fish.
 Cheese Sprinkle mustard seeds over strips  
of puff pastry with grated strong cheese to make 
cheese straws. Kitchen
