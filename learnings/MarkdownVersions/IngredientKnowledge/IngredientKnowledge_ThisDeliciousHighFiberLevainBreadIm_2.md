## The Insight

75% WHOLE WHEAT LEVAIN BREAD
This delicious high-fiber levain bread improves in flavor for a couple of days after it is
baked. I get flavors of nut butter and Wheatena in this bread and love it with good dairy
butter or simply toasted. It’s also wonderful with a nice soft Robiola cheese, apricot
jam, or potted duck liver.
You may notice that this bread has slightly less yeast than the other breads in this
chapter that are made on the same schedule. This is because whole wheat flour has more
nutrients for yeast and therefore ferments faster than white flour. The bran in whole
wheat flour cuts through the gluten strands in the dough, resulting in a somewhat smaller,
denser loaf. Who cares? It’s not a brick. The texture and volume of this loaf are very
impressive for the amount of whole grain it carries. I love this bread.
THIS RECIPE MAKES 2 LOAVES, EACH ABOUT 1½ POUNDS.
BULK FERMENTATION:
 About 5 hours
PROOF TIME:
 12 to 13 hours
SAMPLE SCHEDULE:
 Feed the levain at 8 a.m., mix the fin
