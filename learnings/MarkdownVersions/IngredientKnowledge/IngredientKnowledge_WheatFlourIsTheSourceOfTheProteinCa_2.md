## The Insight

910 Chapter 31  bakeshop production: basic principles and ingredients
Wheat flour is the source of the protein called gluten, which you remember is one of the 
essential elements in baking. bakers select flour on the basis of its gluten content. Flours high in 
protein are called strong, and those low in protein are called weak. (Note: r ye, barley, oats, and some 
other grains also contain gluten proteins, but these proteins do not develop into a gluten structure 
as do the proteins in wheat flour. thus, for the baker, these other grains in effect do not contain 
gluten, but people with gluten intolerance may still have to avoid them in their diets.)
For our purposes, in the small bakeshop, we need to know about three kinds of wheat flour:
1. Bread flour is a strong flour used for making breads, hard rolls, and any product that requires 
high gluten. the best bread flours are patent flours, which come from the interior portions of 
the kernel. Straight flours are also strong flours.
