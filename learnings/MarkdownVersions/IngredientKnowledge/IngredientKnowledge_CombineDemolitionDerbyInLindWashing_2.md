## The Insight

Combine Demolition Derby in Lind, Washington. Gotta have some fun!
Protein content has long been a measure of marketability for wheat. The demand
from large, industrial bakeries for high-protein flour places a premium on wheat
with a higher percentage of protein. Protein content goes up as the plant gets
stressed, and stress is higher when the plant has less moisture (to a point—
obviously there is a minimum amount of moisture needed for the plant to produce).
This year the protein content will be a bit lower because of the late spring and cool
summer. The 
quality
 of protein, however, relates to the gluten’s ability to retain
fermentation gases and expand without breaking, and this is governed more by the
genetics of the variety of wheat and environmental factors like soil health than it is
by soil moisture content. So a harvest with lower protein content can have protein
of excellent quality. Bakers like me prefer lower-protein flour. I told them not to
worry about protein content o
