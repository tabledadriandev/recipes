## The Insight

33943Quick breads are the perfect solution for operations that want to offer their patrons 
fresh, homemade bread products but can’t justify the labor cost of making yeast breads. Also, quick breads have the advantage of being easily made in almost unlim-
ited varieties, using such ingredients as whole wheat flour, rye flour, cornmeal, bran, 
oatmeal, and many kinds of fruits, nuts, and spices.
As their name implies, quick breads are quick to make. Because they are leavened 
by chemical leaveners and steam, not by yeast, no fermentation time is necessary. And because they are usually tender products with little gluten development, mixing 
them takes just a few minutes.
Although prepared biscuit and muffin mixes are available, the only extra work 
required to make these products from scratch is the time to scale a few extra ingredi-ents. With a careful and imaginative selection of ingredients and an understanding of 
basic mixing methods, you can create superior products.
