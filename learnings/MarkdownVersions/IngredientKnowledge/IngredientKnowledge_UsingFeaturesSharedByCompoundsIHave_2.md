## The Insight

13 Spices and their Flavour Compounds
Using features shared by compounds, I have organised 
spices into 12 flavour groups. Their characteristics are described in the chart below, and we have translated the groupings into a Periodic T able of Spices on pp14-15. Some elements of a spice’s taste are not strictly flavour compounds because they cannot be sensed by the  nose and so have no aroma or flavour. These substances (technically termed “tastants”) act directly on the tongue, and include sugars and tart acids. Many are chemicals intended to deter predators – but which humans can enjoy – causing bitterness, numbness, coldness, or, in  the case of pungent compounds, spicy heat.
SULPHUROUS COMPOUNDS
Spices in this group tend to be dominated by oniony 
and meaty flavours, with cabbage- and horseradish-
like nuances and a degree of pungency. In high 
concentrations, sulphur compounds can smell 
offensive and fetid. PUNGENT COMPOUNDS
These sometimes alarmingly hot spices share 
compounds th
