## The Insight

Dough Tub
You’ll need a 12-quart round tub with a lid for mixing your dough by hand and to hold
the dough as it rises. I recommend Cambro brand translucent polycarbonate 
tubs; the
model number is RFSCW12. These tubs are available online from Amazon and at most
restaurant supply stores that sell to the public.
If you choose another brand, that’s fine; just be sure it’s a food-grade container. What
is important is the size; it needs to be big enough to allow you to mix and fold the dough
by hand within the container and to contain the dough as it expands. The round shape
makes it easy to incorporate the ingredients, whereas squared edges and corners tend to
trap ingredients. A clear container is best because you can see through it to chart the
progress of the rise. And of course you need a lid to keep the dough from drying out
during its long rise.
The advantage to using a big, 12-quart tub is that you can do everything inside it:
weighing, mixing, and folding the dough. There isn’t any
