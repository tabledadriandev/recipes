## The Insight

A single hardworking yeast cell can divide, or bud, more than a dozen times. In the
right environment, this replication, and that of all of the offspring, produces billions of
yeast cells, each producing the gas that leavens and flavors the dough. Every time the
levain is fed with flour and water, a new cycle of yeast replication and fermentation
begins, and ultimately the entire dough mass is bubbling, lively with potential, and ready
to be used to make more bread.
