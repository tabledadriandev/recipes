# Garum de Champignon #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Fermentation #Umami

**Preface:** A deep, umami-rich condiment, utilizing the ancient fermentation technique of _garum_ to concentrate the earthy essence of mushrooms and rice koji.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 1 kg fresh mushrooms (chestnut or shiitake)

  - 320 g water

  - 210 g rice koji

  - 85 g fine salt

**Method**

1. Activate the enzymes: Blend the salt, rice koji, and water until homogenous.

2. Add the mushrooms and blend into a coarse, uniform pulp.

3. Transfer the pulp to a sterilized jar, place a weighted bag on top, and cover with a breathable lid.

4. Ferment at ambient temperature (approximately 21°C) for 6 weeks. Stir daily for the first 2 weeks, then weekly.

5. After fermentation, filter the liquid through fine muslin cloth or clarify using the ice clarification method.

6. Store the resulting _garum_ in a sterilized bottle in the refrigerator for up to 6 months, or pasteurize for extended shelf life.

**Technical Notes:** The controlled fermentation process breaks down proteins into amino acids, yielding a profound, natural umami.
