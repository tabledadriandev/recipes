# Conservation et Stockage des Préparations Moléculaires #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Prep

**Preface:** A disciplined protocol for maintaining the integrity and stability of advanced culinary components, ensuring peak quality for service.

**Ingredients**

- **General Rules:** Cleanliness, refrigeration, inert containers.

- **Sensitive Liquids:** Chlorophyll, beta-carotene oils.

- **Dry Components:** Powders, dusts.

- **Service Components:** Spheres, foams, oils.

**Method**

1. **Hygiene:** Execute all preparations under the strictest sanitary conditions to mitigate microbial contamination.

2. **Temperature Control:** Mandate refrigeration for all preparations unless the component is a pure oil or powder.

3. **Oxidation Control:** Vacuum seal sensitive liquids (e.g., chlorophyll, beta-carotene oils) to prevent oxidation.

4. **Container Integrity:** Utilize only inert containers (glass or high-grade food plastic); avoid reactive metals.

5. **Light Exposure:** Shield chlorophyll, oils, and essential oil infusions from light exposure to prevent degradation of colour and flavour.

6. **Humidity Control:** Control humidity for powders and dusts; utilize silica gel packs in storage boxes to maintain a brittle texture.

7. **Service Timing:** Prepare spheres and pearls on the day of service (maximum 2–3 hours prior). Whip foams at the final moment of plating. Prepare oils and powders in advance to manage service timing.

**Technical Notes:** The rapid degradation of hydrocolloid structures and volatile aromatic compounds necessitates strict adherence to these storage protocols.\
**Chef’s Intention:** Disciplined storage ensures the integrity of the final plate, reflecting the commitment to quality at every stage.\
