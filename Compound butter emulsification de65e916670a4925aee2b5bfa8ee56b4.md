**Principle**

Flavoring solids dispersed in plastic butter then re‑emulsified for service.

- Parameters
    - Temp: mix at 18–22 °C, serve melted 55–60 °C
    - Salt: 0.8–1.2%
    - Hydration: few drops water or jus to bind if crumbly
- Goal
    - Texture: homogeneous, sliceable cold, glossy when melted
    - Aroma: clean butter carrying added notes
