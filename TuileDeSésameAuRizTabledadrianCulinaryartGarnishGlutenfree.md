# Tuile de Sésame au Riz #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Garnish #GlutenFree

**Preface:** A gluten-free crisp, utilizing tahini and rice flour to impart a deep, nutty flavour and a distinctive honeycomb structure.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 40 g egg whites (approx. 1 large)

  - 35 g runny tahini (well-mixed)

  - 30 g powdered sugar

  - 10 g rice flour

  - 1 pinch fine salt

  - Optional: vanilla or sesame oil for aroma

**Method**

1. In a bowl, combine the egg whites, tahini, powdered sugar, rice flour, and salt. Whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.

2. Spread the batter thinly into a honeycomb or patterned silicone mold.

3. Bake at 150°C until the tuiles are set and lightly coloured.

4. Remove from the mold while still warm and allow to cool completely to achieve maximum crispness.

**Technical Notes:** The low baking temperature ensures the tahini's delicate oils do not burn while the structure sets.

**Chef’s Intention:** A subtle, savoury-sweet element that introduces an unexpected textural dimension to the plate.

**Metadata:**

- Season: All

- Ingredient: Tahini

- Dish Type: Garnish\
  **Pairing Suggestion:** A dry, aromatic Japanese Sake.
