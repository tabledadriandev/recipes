# Beurre et Consommé de Champignon #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Butter #Broth

**Preface:** A dual-purpose preparation, yielding a deep, earthy broth and a concentrated compound butter, both rooted in the umami of the forest floor.

**Ingredients**

- **Broth Base:**

  - 1 L water

  - 500 g chestnut mushrooms

  - 500 ml chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegan base)

  - 90 ml soy sauce

  - 40 ml miso paste

  - 10 g kombu

  - White pepper, salt (to season)

- **Butter Finish:**

  - Soft unsalted butter (or cashew cream/coconut oil for vegan)

**Method**

1. **Broth:** Combine all broth ingredients. Simmer gently for 45 minutes. Reduce the liquid by one-third to concentrate the flavour.

2. Strain the broth through a fine chinois. Reserve the liquid (Consommé).

3. **Butter:** Emulsify the reserved broth reduction into softened butter (_beurre monté_ technique) until a smooth, compound butter is formed.

4. **Vegan Butter:** Blend the reserved broth reduction with cashew cream and coconut oil to achieve a stable, plant-based butter substitute.

**Technical Notes:** The reduction of the broth is critical for concentrating the umami from the kombu and miso.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, earthy component that provides a profound depth of flavour to a savoury composition.\
**Metadata:**

- Season: Autumn

- Ingredient: Mushroom

  **Pairing Suggestion:** A light, earthy Beaujolais.
