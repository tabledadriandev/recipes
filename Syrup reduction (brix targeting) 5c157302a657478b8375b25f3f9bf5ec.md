# Syrup reduction (brix targeting)

Applications: Glazes, candies, fruit coils
Confidence: 80
Corrections: Add glucose, clean edges, lower heat
Failure modes: Crystallization, scorching
Medium: Sugar
Notes: Use refractometer to hit Brix.
Sensory cue: Thread to soft-ball as target
Source: In-house
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 105–118
Time range: 10–30 min
Tools used: Saucepan, refractometer
Type: Reduction

**Principle**

Concentrate sucrose solutions to target Brix for texture and stability.

- Parameters
    - Temp: 105–118 °C (thread to soft-ball)
    - Brix: measure with refractometer to spec
    - Additives: glucose or acid to prevent crystallization
- Goal
    - Texture: target thread/soft-ball per application
    - Flavor: no scorching or bitterness

⚠️

Sensory benchmark: clear amber syrup, no crystals on pan walls

- Test
    - Variable: glucose % 0 vs 5 vs 10
    - Observe: crystallization, viscosity
    - Acceptance: no crystallization for 24 h at room temp
- Uses
    - Glazes, candies, fruit coils
