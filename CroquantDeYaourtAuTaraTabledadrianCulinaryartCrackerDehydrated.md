# Croquant de Yaourt au Tara #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Cracker #Dehydrated

**Preface:** A dehydrated, savoury crisp, utilizing the stabilizing properties of Tara gum to achieve a brittle structure from a dairy base.

**Ingredients**

- **Base (Yields 40–60):**

  - 450 g full-fat yogurt (or plant-based alternative)

  - 45 g granulated sugar

  - 12 g Tara gum (or 10 g Kuzu starch)

**Method**

1. Put all the ingredients in a container. Emulsify using an immersion blender until the mixture is completely smooth and homogenous.

2. Spread the mixture very thinly onto a silicone mat using a disciplined spatula technique, ensuring a uniform layer.

3. Dehydrate at 70°C for 4–6 hours, or until the sheet is completely dry and brittle.

4. Break the resulting sheet into geometric or organic pieces for plating.

**Technical Notes:** Tara gum acts as a hydrocolloid, providing the necessary structure for dehydration without the need for flour.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A light, acidic, and textural counterpoint to richer savoury components.\
