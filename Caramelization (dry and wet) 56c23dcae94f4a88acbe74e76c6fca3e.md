# Caramelization (dry and wet)

Applications: Sauces, glazes, desserts
Confidence: 85
Corrections: Clean sides, add acid or glucose, lower heat
Failure modes: Crystallization, scorching
Medium: Sugar
Notes: Wet method safer for even heat.
Sensory cue: Amber color, nutty aroma
Source: EMP
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 160–180
Time range: 5–20 min
Tools used: Saucepan, thermometer
Type: Reduction

### Method

1) Combine sugar and water (wet method) or heat sugar alone (dry). 2) Cook to target 160–180 °C without stirring; wash pan sides with wet brush. 3) Add glucose or a drop of acid if needed to prevent crystallization. 4) Use immediately or deglaze to sauce.

### Notes

- Measure Brix with refractometer for repeatability.
- Sensory: clear amber, no graininess. Test glucose at 0, 5, 10%; acceptance = no crystals for 24 h.
- Uses: sauces, glazes, fruit coils.
