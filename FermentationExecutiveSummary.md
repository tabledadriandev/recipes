# Fermentation: Executive Summary

- Fermentation is controlled microbe chemistry used for flavor, preservation, and texture.

- Key processes covered: Lacto, Kombucha, Vinegar, Koji, Miso/Peaso, Shoyu, Garum, and Blackening.

- **Lacto**: Uses 2% salt by weight as the default, aiming for simple, safe, and versatile results.

- **Koji**: Inoculated grain at \~30 °C acts as the enzyme engine for many other ferments.

- **Garum**: Enzymatic sauce, often accelerated at \~60 °C with \~12% salt, using plant bases.

- **Blackening**: A non-microbial process using weeks at \~60 °C for Maillard-driven "black" fruits/garlic.
