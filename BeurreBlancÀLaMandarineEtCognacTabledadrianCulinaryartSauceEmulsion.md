# Beurre Blanc à la Mandarine et Cognac #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Sauce #Emulsion

**Preface:** A classic French emulsion, refined by the bright acidity of mandarin and the aromatic depth of aged brandy.

**Ingredients**

- **Reduction Base:**

  - 50 g apple cider vinegar

  - 20 g shallot (finely chopped)

  - 5 g aged brandy (Cognac or Armagnac)

  - 3 g green peppercorns

  - 3 g mandarin peel (zest only)

  - 2 g garlic (finely chopped)

- **Finish:**

  - 200 g cold unsalted butter (cubed)

  - 50 g fresh double cream

  - 3 g fine salt

  - Mandarin oil (to finish)

**Method**

1. In a saucepan, sauté the shallot, garlic, and mandarin peel in a small knob of butter over low heat until translucent.

2. Deglaze the pan with the apple cider vinegar and brandy. Add the green peppercorns. Reduce the liquid by two-thirds over 20 minutes.

3. Strain the reduction through a fine sieve, discarding the solids.

4. Return the liquid to the pan. Blend in the fresh cream.

5. Gradually incorporate the cold, cubed butter using an immersion blender to emulsify and mount the sauce (_beurre monté_ technique).

6. Finish the sauce with a few drops of mandarin oil for aromatic lift. Season with salt.

**Technical Notes:** The _beurre monté_ technique is essential for creating a stable, velvety emulsion. The butter must be incorporated cold and gradually.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, acidic sauce that cuts through the richness of a primary protein while referencing the citrus of the Côte d’Azur.\
