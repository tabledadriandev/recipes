Medium: Water
Notes: Salt 2–3% over total weight.
Sensory cue: Lactic tang, fine bubbles, crisp texture
Source: In-house
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 18–22
Time range: 3–14 d
Tools used: Jars, airlocks, scale
Type: Fermentation

**Principle**

Vegetable preservation via lactic acid production at cool ambient temperatures.

- Parameters
    - Salt: 2–3% over total weight
    - Temp: 18–22 °C
    - Time: 3–14 days (taste daily after day 3)
    - Vessel: anaerobic, veg fully submerged
- Goal
    - Texture: crisp
    - Aroma: clean lactic tang
    - Visual: fine bubbles, no film

<aside>
⚠️

Sensory benchmark: bright acidity, no yeast film, no mushiness

- Test
    - Variable: salt 2.0% vs 2.5% vs 3.0%
    - Observe: crunch score, days to target acidity, surface growth
    - Acceptance: pH ≤3.8 by day 7, crisp texture
- Uses
    - Veg: cucumber coins, carrot batons
    - Meat: relish for rich cuts
    - Fish: tartar relish
    - Dessert: fermented fruit syrups
