Spherification

1. Basic Sphere Recipe (Without Sodium Alginate)

(Agar-based manual spheres instead of true liquid spherification)

Ingredients:
	•	200 g vegetable juice or extraction (e.g., parsley juice, carrot juice, beetroot juice)
	•	2 g agar-agar powder (1% of liquid weight)
	•	Pinch of salt or sugar (depending on taste)

Method:
	1.	Bring the juice to a boil.
	2.	Whisk in agar-agar powder.
	3.	Boil 10–15 seconds to activate agar fully.
	4.	Cool slightly (~60–70°C).
	5.	Using a pipette or spoon, drop into cold oil or directly mold into tiny spheres manually.
	6.	Chill fully to set.

Substitutions:
	•	Parsley, carrot, beetroot, red cabbage, blueberry juice — all fine — same quantities.
