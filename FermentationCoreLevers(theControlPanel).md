# Fermentation: Core Levers (The Control Panel)

The core levers for controlling fermentation (the "control panel") are:

- **Salt**: Controls water activity and microbe pressure.

- **pH**: Suppresses pathogens and dictates brightness/flavor profile.

- **Temperature**: Determines speed and pathway of the fermentation.

- **Oxygen**: Critical for process control (e.g., lacto off, vinegar on).

- **Time**: Balances complexity against the risk of defects.

- **Water Activity**: (Implied by salt and water content).

**Chapter Thesis**: Flavor is engineered by microbes under constraints; master the constraints.
