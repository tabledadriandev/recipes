Molecular Gastronomy Preparations: Shelf Life and Storage

Preparation	Shelf Life	Storage Conditions	Important Notes
Chlorophyll Extract (Liquid)	1–2 days	Airtight container, refrigerated (0–4°C)	Sensitive to oxygen and light — turns brown quickly. Vacuum sealing helps.
Chlorophyll Pearls (Alginate Spheres)	4–6 hours	Immersed in water bath, refrigerated	Keep in neutral water to avoid flavor transfer. After 6h, membrane thickens.
Chlorophyll Oil	1 week	Airtight container, refrigerated	Oil preserves chlorophyll longer. Avoid direct light.
Beta-Carotene Oil	1–2 weeks	Airtight bottle, refrigerated	Keep oil phase pure (no water contamination) to avoid spoilage.
Beta-Carotene Foam (with lecithin or aquafaba)	20–40 min (active foam)	Use immediately	Foams are highly unstable — prepare à la minute (just before serving).
Beta-Carotene Dust (Oil + Maltodextrin powder)	3–5 days	Airtight container, dry, cool place	Humidity kills powders. Keep away from moisture!
Anthocyanin Pearls (Color-changing Spheres)	4–6 hours	In pH-neutral water bath, refrigerated	Acidic or basic solutions may alter color over time.
Lycopene Oil (Tomato Oil)	1–2 weeks	Airtight bottle, refrigerated	Same storage as beta-carotene oil.
Capsaicin Oil (Chili Infusion)	2–3 weeks	Airtight dark glass bottle, refrigerated	Longer shelf life due to capsaicin being antimicrobial.
Beet Betalain Syrup	3–5 days	Airtight container, refrigerated	Can start fermenting after a few days if not fully reduced.
Agar-Agar Gels (Carrot or Beet Gels)	2–3 days	Airtight container, refrigerated	Agar gels can lose water (“syneresis”) after 2–3 days. Best texture is 24h max.
Pectin Gels (Fruit-Based)	3–5 days	Airtight container, refrigerated	Stable texture, good for a few days if no contamination.
Spicy Mango Spheres (Capsaicin/Mango)	4–6 hours	In clean water bath, refrigerated	Like other spheres — longer storage thickens the membrane.
Herb Essential Oil Infusions (Basil, Rosemary)	1–2 weeks	Airtight bottle, dark, refrigerated	Sunlight degrades essential oils quickly.

General Molecular Gastronomy Storage Rules
	•	Always work as clean as possible — any contamination reduces shelf life.
	•	Refrigeration is almost always mandatory unless it’s a pure oil or pure powder.
	•	Vacuum seal if you can for sensitive liquids (chlorophyll, beta-carotene oils).
	•	Use inert containers (glass or high-grade food plastic), no reactive metals.
	•	Avoid light exposure for chlorophyll, oils, and essential oil infusions.
	•	Control humidity for powders and dusts (silica gel packs in storage boxes help).

Visual Quick Guide

Stable (Days to Weeks)	Fragile (Hours Only)
Oils (Chlorophyll, Beta-Carotene, Lycopene, Capsaicin)	Foams (Chlorophyll, Beta-Carotene)
Powders (Beta-Carotene Dust)	Spheres/Pearls (Chlorophyll, Anthocyanin, Mango)
Gels (Pectin, Agar-Agar)	Fresh foams without stabilizers

Pro Tip for Service
	•	Spheres/pearls: Always make same day — better 2–3h before service max.
	•	Foams: Whip at the very last moment.
	•	Oils and powders: Prepare in advance — they help you manage service timing.
