**Preface:** A light, steamed bun, utilizing a blend of rice starches and xanthan gum to replicate the classic, airy texture without gluten.• Soy sauce and sesame oil (to taste)

**Ingredients**

- **Dough:**

  - 250 g rice flour

  - 200 ml warm water (40°C)

  - 1 tbsp olive oil

  - 1 tsp granulated sugar

  - ½ tsp fine salt

  - 2 tsp dry yeast

  - 1 tsp xanthan gum

  - ½ tsp baking powder

  - _Optional Starch Blend:_ Rice flour, corn flour, potato starch

- **Filling (Example):**

  - 1 clove minced garlic

  - Grated ginger (to taste)

  - Cooked meat (chicken, beef, or other)

  - Soy sauce and sesame oil (to taste)

**Method**

1. In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, dry yeast, xanthan gum, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to distribute the stabilizers evenly.

2. Introduce the warm water and olive oil. Mix and knead for 8 minutes until a smooth, slightly tacky dough forms.

3. Allow the dough to proof in a warm environment until doubled in volume (approximately 1 hour).

4. Divide the dough into 40g portions. Form into smooth spheres and flatten into discs.

5. Fold the discs into the classic bao shape. Proof again for 20 minutes.

6. Steam the buns for 10–12 minutes until light and airy.

**Technical Notes:** Xanthan gum is the critical stabilizer, providing the necessary elasticity and structure in the absence of wheat gluten.
