Chlorophyll Extract

1. Extraction of Chlorophyll (Simple Culinary Method)

You’ll need:
	•	Fresh parsley (or other green herbs)
	•	Ice water
	•	Blender
	•	Fine strainer or chinois
	•	Cheesecloth or coffee filters
	•	Shallow tray
	•	Small saucepan
	•	Ice bath

Step-by-step:
	1.	Blanch the parsley: Quickly dip parsley into boiling water for 10–15 seconds, then immediately transfer into ice water to stop cooking. This locks in vibrant green color and protects the chlorophyll.
	2.	Dry lightly: Gently pat the parsley dry with paper towels.
	3.	Blend with a small amount of ice-cold water: Use just enough water to help the blender break down the leaves into a smooth purée.
	4.	Strain carefully: Pass the purée through a fine mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth, squeezing out as much green liquid as possible.
	5.	Optional – Oil infusion: If you want a chlorophyll oil, blend parsley with a neutral oil (like grapeseed), strain, and then gently heat at ~60°C (not above 70°C or it browns) to separate the chlorophyll into the oil.

2. Concentrating the Chlorophyll (Optional for Higher Purity)
	•	After extraction, you can gently heat the strained green liquid at low temperatures (~50–60°C) to evaporate water, concentrating the chlorophyll.
	•	Be careful: do not boil or it will turn brown (pheophytin formation).

Some chefs even spin it in a centrifuge to separate pure chlorophyll sediment, but for most gastronomy applications, careful straining is enough.

3. Storing Chlorophyll

Short-term:
	•	Store the extracted chlorophyll liquid in a squeeze bottle or pipette bottle.
	•	Keep it refrigerated for up to 2 days.

Medium-term:
	•	For better shelf life, vacuum-seal and freeze in small portions (e.g., in silicone molds).

Pro tip:
	•	Chlorophyll oxidizes quickly, so low oxygen storage (vacuum, nitrogen flush if available) preserves color.

4. Using Chlorophyll in Micro Molecular Gastronomy

Some ideas:
	•	Chlorophyll pearls: Mix chlorophyll concentrate with sodium alginate and drip into a calcium bath to create green caviar.
	•	Chlorophyll foams: Whip into light foams using lecithin or soy proteins.
	•	Chlorophyll gels: Blend into agar-agar gels or fluid gels for pure color and slight vegetal taste.
	•	Chlorophyll oils: Use for plate decoration, vinaigrettes, or to create chlorophyll ‘glass’ sheets (dehydrated oil).
	•	Chlorophyll pasta: Incorporate into fresh pasta dough or gnocchi for vivid green color without artificial dyes.
	•	Chlorophyll emulsion: Create silky emulsions with chlorophyll and neutral oils for a brilliant visual and flavor impact.
