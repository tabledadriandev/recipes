Molecular Tasting Menu

Avant-Garde Molecular Dish 1: “The Garden Awakens”

Concept:
A fresh, vivid appetizer where the garden’s green and orange pigments come alive in different textures.

Core Extractions:
	•	Chlorophyll pearls (from parsley)
	•	Beta-carotene foam (from carrots)

Composition:
	•	A base of chilled pea purée (smooth and vegetal).
	•	Dot chlorophyll pearls across the purée.
	•	Crown the dish with a light beta-carotene foam (bright orange).
	•	Garnish with micro herbs (like basil and cilantro).

Techniques:
	•	Chlorophyll pearls: Spherification with sodium alginate.
	•	Beta-carotene foam: Emulsify carrot oil with lecithin or aquafaba, siphon foam.

Visual:
Bright green pearls popping from orange foam over a green base.
Fresh, airy, alive.

Avant-Garde Molecular Dish 2: “Chromatic Symphony”

Concept:
An interchanging flavor and color experience through pH-reactive pearls.

Core Extractions:
	•	Anthocyanin pearls (from red cabbage or blueberries)

Composition:
	•	Coconut cream base (sweet, neutral).
	•	Scatter anthocyanin pearls over the cream.
	•	Serve with a tiny pipette of lime juice inserted into the dish.

Techniques:
	•	Anthocyanin pearls: Direct spherification.
	•	Color reaction: Pearls change from blue to pink when guests squeeze the lime over them (pH shift!).

Visual:
	•	Pearls start deep blue/purple and explode into pink when acid touches them.
	•	Magical color show on the plate — guest participation element.

Avant-Garde Molecular Dish 3: “Fire and Ice”

Concept:
Play between cold spice and creamy coolness.

Core Extractions:
	•	Capsaicin-infused oil (from chili)
	•	Beta-carotene dust (dehydrated carrot oil with maltodextrin)

Composition:
	•	Mango sorbet quenelle in the center.
	•	Drizzle with a few drops of capsaicin oil.
	•	Sprinkle beta-carotene dust around like “embers.”

Techniques:
	•	Capsaicin oil: Low-temp infusion.
	•	Beta-carotene dust: Blend beta-carotene oil with maltodextrin until it forms a dry powder.

Visual:
	•	Bright yellow sorbet sitting in a “fire” ring of orange dust.
	•	Unexpected chili heat contrasts with the icy cold mango.
