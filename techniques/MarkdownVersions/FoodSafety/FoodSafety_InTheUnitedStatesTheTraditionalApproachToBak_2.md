## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. enough time, but not much effort—a little over seven hours for the simplest recipes in
this book—to achieve a really good loaf

2. In the United States, the traditional approach to baking bread has been to think of the
rise as simply a short amount of time—just an hour or two—necessary for gas to build
up in the dough to give it structure

3. I and other good bakers view the rise as an
opportunity to build flavor and an appropriate amount of acidity

4. Temperature and time have an inverse relationship, and I like the visual image of a
seesaw to communicate the need for balance between the two: more of one means you
need less of the other

5. A warm dough develops more quickly, whereas a cooler dough
develops more slowly

6. Specifically, dough temperature affects the metabolic rate of the
yeast: warmer yeast replicates more quickly

7. Once a dough is mixed, the yeast replicates
until no oxygen remains in the dough, at which point the yeast cells, as they consume
sugars from the flour, begin to produce gases (carbon dioxide and ethanol)

8. This gas production is what causes the dough to rise

9. Bulk fermentation
 The first rise of the dough after all of the
ingredients have been mixed together (flour, water, salt, and yeast,
plus any levain or pre-fermented doughs)
