## Overview

There remain many bakeries, mine included, that still bake large loaves for
people who do not have everyday access to a bakery, or who know from experience
that large loaves yield superior bread. In my case, almost all of these big fellas are
delivered to a handful of good restaurants here in Portland.
I am fond of these large loaves for their historical link to a baking heritage that

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. There remain many bakeries, mine included, that still bake large loaves for
people who do not have everyday access to a bakery, or who know from experience
that large loaves yield superior bread

2. In my case, almost all of these big fellas are
delivered to a handful of good restaurants here in Portland

3. I am fond of these large loaves for their historical link to a baking heritage that
inspired my métier, and the 3-kilo (6.6-pound) 
boule
 of Country Blonde is the one
bread I can truly call my own

4. I came up with the recipe for the bakery’s Country
Brown bread to try to match loaves baked by the French bakers who inspired me—
Poilâne, Poujauran, Kamir, Saibron, and other excellent Parisian bakers—despite
the differences between the types of flour available in the United States and France

5. Country Brown is one of my personal favorites in 1.75-kilo (3.9-pound) 
boules
, but
the 3-kilo Country Blonde 
boule
 came more directly from my own inspiration and I
therefore feel it is more my own bread, not my version of someone else’s bread

6. In 2004, I traveled back to Paris for my first vacation since opening Ken’s
Artisan Bakery

7. It was an opportunity to revisit the 
boulangeries
 that made me want
to become a baker—and to give some long thought to the work we were doing in
Portland

8. I also wanted to adopt a common practice among good French
bakers: using a small percentage of rye flour to add earthiness and additional
complexity to the flavor of the bread

9. After I got home I tinkered with flour proportions (at the time I used four kinds of
flour in the Country Blonde dough), the amount of levain and yeast, the timing,
dough temperatures, and dough hydration
