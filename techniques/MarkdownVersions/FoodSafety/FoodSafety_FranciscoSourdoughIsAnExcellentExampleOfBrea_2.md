## Overview

Francisco sourdough is an excellent example of bread with strong acetic character—
think “vinegary.” Levain 
cultures kept in cooler temperatures also lean toward the acetic
end of the taste spectrum, as do stiffer levains. Bread made from a liquid levain, with
equal parts flour and water (it has a soupy texture), has a distinctive flavor profile that
leans toward the lactic acid end of the taste spectrum. Warmer levain cultures encourage
lactic acid production, and just like the top-fermented a

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Francisco sourdough is an excellent example of bread with strong acetic character—
think “vinegary.” Levain 
cultures kept in cooler temperatures also lean toward the acetic
end of the taste spectrum, as do stiffer levains

2. Bread made from a liquid levain, with
equal parts flour and water (it has a soupy texture), has a distinctive flavor profile that
leans toward the lactic acid end of the taste spectrum

3. Warmer levain cultures encourage
lactic acid production, and just like the top-fermented ales that brewers ferment at
warmer temperatures, these can produce fermented fruit flavors, especially when they
get particularly ripe

5. Here goes, with a shout-out to 
Teri Wadsworth and 
John
Paul of Cameron Winery in Dundee, Oregon

6. The levain is a symbiotic culture of 
lactic
acid bacteria and yeast

7. Lactic acid bacteria are a diverse group of bacteria that produce
lactic acid, carbon dioxide, a small amount of ethanol, and other volatile flavor
components as the end product of carbohydrate fermentation

8. Under the right conditions,
lactic acid bacteria can also produce acetic acid

9. In a levain, the lactic acid bacteria
feed mostly on the yeast’s metabolic by-products

10. As with natural yeast fermentation,
time is required for the bacteria to grow and produce acids and other flavor components
