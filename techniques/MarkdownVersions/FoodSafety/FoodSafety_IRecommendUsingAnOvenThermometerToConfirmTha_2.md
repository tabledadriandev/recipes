## Overview

I recommend using an oven thermometer to confirm that when you set your oven to
475ºF, you actually get 475ºF. Some ovens run hotter than their setting, and some

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. I recommend using an oven thermometer to confirm that when you set your oven to
475ºF, you actually get 475ºF

2. Some ovens run hotter than their setting, and some
run cooler

3. (Mine runs 25ºF cooler, so when I want to heat it to 475ºF, I set it to
500ºF.)
WHAT IF THE DOUGH ISN’T AT THE TARGET 
TEMPERATURE

4. If the 
final mix temperature is cooler, don’t worry, it will just take longer to fully
rise (in this case trip
ling in size)

5. If you have a warm spot where the dough can
rise, that will help make up for the cooler dough temperature

6. If your dough is
warmer, the dough will triple in size sooner

7. (The next time you make the recipe,
you can adjust the final mix temperature by using warmer or cooler water.)
