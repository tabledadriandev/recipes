## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Remove the roast from the roasting pan.

2. Clarify the fat. Set the roasting pan over high heat and cook until all the moisture has evaporated, leaving only the fat, mirepoix, and the brown (caramelized) drippings. Pour off and save the fat.

3. Deglaze the pan. Pour stock or other liquid into the roasting pan. Stir over heat until the caramelized drippings are dissolved.

4. Combine with stock and simmer. Pour the deglazing liquid, plus mirepoix, into a large pot with desired amount of stock. Simmer until mirepoix is well cooked. Skim the surface well to remove fat and scum.

5. Make a roux or, alternatively, a slurry of arrowroot or cornstarch and water. For roux, measure enough of the fat from step 2 to make the correct amount of roux for the volume of gravy. Make a blond or brown roux, as desired. For starch slurry, see page 177.

6. Thicken the gravy with the roux or starch slurry.

7. Adjust seasonings.

8. Remove the roast from the roasting pan.

9. Clarify the fat.

10. Add flour to the roasting pan and make a roux.

11. Add stock. Stir until thickened and the pan is deglazed.

12. Strain. Skim excess fat.

13. Adjust consistency, if necessary, with more stock or more roux.
