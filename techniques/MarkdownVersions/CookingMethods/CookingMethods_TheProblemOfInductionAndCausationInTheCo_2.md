THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION AND CAUSATION IN THE COMPLEX DOMAIN
What Is Complexity?
I will simplify here with a functional definition of complexity—among many more complete ones. A complex domain is characterized by the following: there is a great degree of interdependence between its elements, both temporal (a variable depends on its past changes), horizontal (variables depend on one another), and diagonal (variable A depends on the past history of variable B). As a result of this interdependence,

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION AND CAUSATION IN THE COMPLEX DOMAIN
What Is Complexity

2. I will simplify here with a functional definition of complexity—among many more complete ones

3. A complex domain is characterized by the following: there is a great degree of interdependence between its elements, both temporal (a variable depends on its past changes), horizontal (variables depend on one another), and diagonal (variable A depends on the past history of variable B)

4. Finally, we have nonlinearities that accentuate the fat tails

5. So, complexity implies Extremistan

6. (The opposite is not necessarily true.)
As a researcher, I have only focused on the Extemistan element of complexity theory, ignoring the other elements except as a backup for my considerations of unpredictability

7. But complexity has other consequences for the conventional analyses, and for causation

8. Induction
Let us look again, from a certain angle, at the problem of “induction.” It becomes one step beyond archaic in a modern environment, making the Black Swan problem even more severe
