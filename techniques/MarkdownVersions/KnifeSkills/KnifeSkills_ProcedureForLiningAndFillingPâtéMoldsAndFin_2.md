## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Prepare the pastry in advance so it has plenty of time to rest.

2. Prepare the molds by greasing them well on the inside. The directions here pertain to standard rectangular pâté molds. These usually are hinged and collapsible so it is easy to remove the pâté without damaging it. If you are using bottomless molds, then also grease the sheet pans on which they are to set. For molds of other shapes, modify the pas-try-molding procedure as necessary to fit the shape.

3. For best results, mold the pastry so it is of even thickness, has no seams, and fits the mold perfectly. First, work the pastry with the hands for a few seconds to make it pliable. Then shape it into a rectangle and roll it slightly with a rolling pin to flatten it, keeping it quite thick.

4. Make an indentation down the center of the dough with the fingers. Gradually make the dough into a sort of boat shape. Dust the inside of the dough shape well with flour (to keep the two layers of dough from sticking together) and fold the dough along the indentation to make a pocket.

5. Gently roll out the dough to make a rectangle the size of the mold. Be careful not to roll the dough too thin, which would make it fragile. Open up the pocket.

6. Fit the opened pocket into the mold. Carefully mold the pastry to the shape of the mold by pushing the dough with your fingers. Make sure there are no air bubbles between the dough and mold. A ball of dough dipped in flour is useful for pushing the dough into the corners of the mold without tearing it.

7. If the pâté is to be made without a top crust, leave a rim of dough about ¼ inch (5 mm) above the top of the mold. Crimp this rim to make a decorative border. If there is to be a top crust, leave a rim of half the width of the mold and let it hang over the sides. (For an alternative method, see step 10.)

8. The mold is now ready to fill. For display pieces, it is common practice to line the inside of the dough with thin sheets of fatback. For pâtés to be eaten, however, it is

9. Baking without a top crust is easier and allows you to make an attractive aspic glaze with decorations for the top.

10. Fold the rim of the dough from the sides of the mold over the top of the filling. If using a top crust:

11. As an alternative method for fitting the top crust:

12. •	Brush the inside of this rim with egg wash.

13. Decorate the top crust with pastry cutouts, if desired. Seal the cutouts to the crust with egg wash. Make one or two vent holes in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Fit pastry tubes into these holes to form chimneys in order to keep juices from running over the top crust and spoiling its appearance.

14. Remove the pâté from the oven. Let the pâté cool to room temperature in its mold. For a pâté made without a top crust, first let it cool until it is warm. Then let it finish cooling with a weight on top in order to give the pâté a firmer texture. The weight should be large enough to cover the meat but small enough so it doesn’t touch the pastry rim. This can be accomplished by cutting a board to the proper size, laying it in place on the pâté, and placing weights on the board. (Obviously, this cannot be done if there is a top crust.) Refrigerate.

15. When the pâté is cold, prepare an aspic jelly. Melt the aspic and flavor it, if desired, with a little sherry, port, or Madeira. Cool it according to the procedure on page 863. Fill the pâté with the aspic.
