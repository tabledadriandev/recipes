## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Weigh the meats and fat. Cut them into chunks small

2. If the sausages are to be cured, toss the cure mix with the diced meat at this point. Alternatively, combine the cure mix with the salt and spices in step 4.

3. Chill the meat well before proceeding.

4. Measure the salt and spices.

5. Grind the meat and fat, following the directions in the recipe to achieve the proper fineness or coarseness of grind.

6. Chill the meat well. Ideally, the meat should be chilled to 32°–35°F (0°–2°C) before mixing and stuffing. Best practice is to grind the meat directly into a bowl set in an ice bath.

7. Combine the meat, salt, and spices and mix thoroughly. For small quantities, this can be done by hand. The best procedure, however, is to use a mixer fitted with an ice bain-marie to keep the meat cold.

8. Test for seasonings. Do not taste the raw meat. Rather, make a small ball or patty and cook it in a small sauté pan or poach it in water. Then cool the meat slightly and taste. If more salt or other seasoning is needed, add it to the  sausage mixture.

9. Place the meat in the stuffer, one handful at a time. Pack each handful firmly into the stuffer to eliminate air bubbles.

10. Slide the casings onto the nozzle. To help the casings slide on easily, moisten both them and the stuffer nozzle with water.

11. Stuff the sausages, following the directions for your equip-ment (Fig. 28.2). The sausages will pull the casings off the nozzle as the meat flows through it, but it is best to hold your hand at the end of the nozzle to help control the rate at which the casing is pulled from the nozzle. From time to time, as the casing is filled, it is necessary to push the bunched-up, unfilled casing toward the end of the nozzle so it will slide off more easily. Do not stuff the casings too tightly. If the meat is packed too tightly, it will be difficult to twist the sausage into links.

12. After all the meat is stuffed into casings, remove any air bubbles by pricking the casing and pressing the surface to expel the air.

13. Twist the sausage into links of uniform size.
