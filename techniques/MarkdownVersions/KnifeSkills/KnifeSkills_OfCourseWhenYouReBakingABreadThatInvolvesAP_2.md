## Overview

large container, fluff it with a fork, and then spoon it into the measuring cup or
spoon until full. Then, use the edge of a knife to level the top of the flour. (If this
sounds like a pain, good … buy a kitchen scale!)
Of course, when you’re baking a bread that involves a pre-ferment, volume
measurements really go out the window. Many of my recipes call for using 100
grams of levain, which is a bit more than ⅓ cup. The problem is, when you scoop

4. Many of my recipes call for using 100
grams of levain, which is a bit more than ⅓ cup
