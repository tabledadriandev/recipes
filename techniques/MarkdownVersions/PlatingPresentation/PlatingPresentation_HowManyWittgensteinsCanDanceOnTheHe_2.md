## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. HOW MANY WITTGENSTEINS CAN DANCE ON THE HEAD OF A PIN

2. A number of semishabbily dressed (but thoughtful-looking) people gather in a room, silently looking at a guest speaker

3. They are all professional philosophers attending the prestigious weekly colloquium at a New York–area university

4. The speaker sits with his nose drowned in a set of typewritten pages, from which he reads in a monotone voice

5. He is hard to follow, so I daydream a bit and lose his thread

6. I can vaguely tell that the discussion revolves around some “philosophical” debate about Martians invading your head and controlling your will, all the while preventing you from knowing it
