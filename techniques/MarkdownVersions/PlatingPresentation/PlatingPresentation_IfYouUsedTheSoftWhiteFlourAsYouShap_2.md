## Overview

If you used the soft white 00 flour, as you shape it you’ll notice how soft and pliable
the dough feels. It’s a beautiful thing.
Proofing the Dough Balls
Lightly dust a rimmed baking sheet or a couple of dinner plates with flour. Put the dough
balls on the pan or plates with some space between them to accommodate their
expansion. Use your hand to lightly oil the tops of the dough balls, or simply dust the tops
with flour. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 60 minut

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. If you used the soft white 00 flour, as you shape it you’ll notice how soft and pliable
the dough feels

2. It’s a beautiful thing

3. Proofing the Dough Balls
Lightly dust a rimmed baking sheet or a couple of dinner plates with flour

4. Put the dough
balls on the pan or plates with some space between them to accommodate their
expansion

5. Use your hand to lightly oil the tops of the dough balls, or simply dust the tops
with flour

6. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes
(or longer for focaccia, as described below), then put into the refrigerator to chill out

7. I
like to let them sit for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before turning them into
pizza, because I find it easier to shape cold dough without tearing it

8. Any leftover dough balls can be kept in the refrigerator a night or two

9. You may even
find that you prefer the next-day dough, as it develops flavor in the refrigerator

10. When I’m making focaccia, I sometimes like to let it develop more than I would if I
were using it for bread or pizza
