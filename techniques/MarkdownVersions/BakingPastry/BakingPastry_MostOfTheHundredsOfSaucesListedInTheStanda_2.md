## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. starches are the most common and most useful thickeners for sauce making. Flour is the principal starch used. Others available to the chef include cornstarch, arrowroot, waxy maize,

2. starches thicken by gelatinization, which, as discussed in chapter 6, is the process by which starch granules absorb water and swell to many times their original size, and starch molecules uncoil into long threads.

3. starch granules must be separated before heating in liquid to avoid lumping. If granules are not separated, lumping occurs because the starch on the outside of the lump quickly gelatinizes into a coating that prevents the liquid from reaching the starch inside.
