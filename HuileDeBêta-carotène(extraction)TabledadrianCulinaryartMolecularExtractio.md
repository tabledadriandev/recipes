# Huile de Bêta-Carotène (Extraction) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Extraction

**Preface:** A pure, concentrated oil, utilizing a low-temperature infusion to extract the vibrant orange pigment and flavour of carrots.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - Fresh carrots (intense orange variety)

  - Neutral oil (grapeseed, sunflower, or light olive oil)

**Method**

1. Peel and finely grate the carrots to maximize surface area.

2. Combine the grated carrots with just enough neutral oil to cover them completely.

3. Gently heat the mixture to 80°C. Maintain this temperature for 30 minutes.

4. Transfer the mixture to a high-speed blender. Blend until the carrots are fully broken down and the oil is intensely coloured.

5. Strain the oil through a fine chinois lined with cheesecloth.

6. Chill the oil rapidly over an ice bath.

7. Transfer the oil to a piping bag and allow it to rest in the refrigerator to separate any residual water or purée. Discard the sediment.

**Technical Notes:** The controlled temperature of 80°C is crucial for maximizing pigment extraction while preventing the oil from developing off-flavours.

**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, vibrant component that provides a pure, concentrated colour and flavour accent.
