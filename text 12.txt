Beta-carotene extraction


How to Extract Beta-Carotene from Carrots (Culinary Method)

You’ll need:
	•	Fresh carrots (the more intense orange, the better)
	•	Neutral oil (like grapeseed, sunflower, or light olive oil)
	•	Blender
	•	Fine strainer or chinois
	•	Saucepan
	•	Ice bath

Steps:
	1.	Peel and finely grate the carrots: More surface area = better pigment extraction.
	2.	Blend with oil:
Add just enough neutral oil to cover the carrots and blend thoroughly until you have a thick paste.
	3.	Gently heat the paste:
Place the carrot–oil mixture in a saucepan.
Heat slowly at around 60–70°C (140–158°F) for 20–30 minutes.
(Never fry — just a very gentle infusion to release beta-carotene into the oil.)
	4.	Cool and strain:
Pass the oil through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth.
You now have beta-carotene-enriched oil — intense orange color, full of flavor.

Storage
	•	Keep refrigerated.
	•	Lasts about 1–2 weeks if properly strained (no water left).

How to Use Beta-Carotene Extract in Molecular Gastronomy
	•	Beta-carotene pearls:
Use the oil to make spherified pearls (sodium alginate bath + beta-carotene oil droplets).
	•	Beta-carotene foam:
Whip the beta-carotene oil into a foam using lecithin or aquafaba for an orange-tinted, aromatic topping.
	•	Beta-carotene gel:
Combine with agar-agar to create vibrant orange gels.
	•	Beta-carotene powder:
Dehydrate the infused oil using maltodextrin powder.
(Result = beautiful carrot-flavored orange “dust” or “snow” for plating.)
	•	Beta-carotene paint:
Mix the oil with a little gum arabic and use for painting on plates.

Extra Tip: If you want a water-based beta-carotene extraction
	•	Juice the carrots.
	•	Clarify the juice (through a chinois, or spin if you have a centrifuge).
	•	Gently reduce the juice over very low heat until it becomes beta-carotene syrup.
	•	This syrup can be spherified, turned into gels, or mixed into foams.


Visual difference between Chlorophyll vs Beta-Carotene extraction
Feature	Chlorophyll	Beta-Carotene
Solubility	Water-soluble, but sensitive	Fat-soluble, oil extraction
Heat Sensitivity	Very sensitive (turns brown)	More heat-tolerant
Use in Molecular Gastronomy	Foams, pearls, emulsions	Oils, pearls, powders, gels
Storage	Short term	Medium term (oil preserves better)
