# Gel Fluide d'Orange Vif #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Component

**Preface:** A highly concentrated, vibrant orange gel, designed for precise plating, offering a pure expression of citrus acidity and sweetness.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 500 ml fresh orange juice (divided)

  - 4 g agar agar powder

  - 30–50 ml fresh lemon juice

  - 25 g granulated sugar

**Method**

1. Pour 250 ml of the orange juice into a saucepan. Reserve the remaining juice.

2. Whisk the sugar and agar powder into the juice in the saucepan.

3. Bring the mixture to a rapid boil and maintain the boil for 1–2 minutes to fully activate the agar. Remove from heat.

4. Introduce the reserved 250 ml of cold orange juice and the lemon juice. Stir to combine.

5. Pour the mixture into a shallow container and chill until completely set.

6. Transfer the set gel to a high-speed blender. Blend until the gel is completely smooth and fluid.

**Technical Notes:** The addition of cold juice after boiling is a crucial step to rapidly set the agar, which is then sheared into a fluid gel.
