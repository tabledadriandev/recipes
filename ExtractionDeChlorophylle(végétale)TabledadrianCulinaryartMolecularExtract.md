# Extraction de Chlorophylle (Végétale) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Extraction

**Preface:** A vibrant, concentrated green pigment, achieved through disciplined blanching and thermal shock to preserve the purity of the herb.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - Fresh parsley (or other green herbs)

  - Ice water

  - Neutral oil (optional, for stabilization)

**Method**

1. **Blanching:** Quickly dip the parsley into boiling water for precisely 10–15 seconds.

2. **Shock:** Immediately transfer the parsley into an ice bath to halt the cooking process and set the vibrant green colour.

3. Blend the shocked parsley with a minimal amount of ice water until a smooth, vibrant purée is achieved.

4. Strain the purée through a fine chinois lined with cheesecloth.

5. **Thermal Separation:** Gently heat the strained liquid in a small saucepan until the chlorophyll separates and floats to the surface (approximately 60–75°C).

6. Skim the concentrated chlorophyll paste from the surface. Chill immediately.

**Technical Notes:** The rapid blanching and shocking process is essential for denaturing the enzymes that cause browning, thus preserving the intense green colour.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, concentrated pigment that provides a pure, visual accent of the garden.\
