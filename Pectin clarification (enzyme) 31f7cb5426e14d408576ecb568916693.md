# Pectin clarification (enzyme)

Applications: Apple, citrus juices
Confidence: 85
Corrections: Longer enzyme contact, antioxidant, cold filter
Failure modes: Residual haze, browning
Medium: Water
Notes: Pectinase 0.1–0.3%.
Sensory cue: Water-clear, intact aroma
Source: In-house
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 40–50 enzyme; 2–4 hold
Time range: 2–12 h
Tools used: Pectinase, filter
Type: Clarify

**Principle**

Pectinase breaks pectin networks; cold filtration yields water-clear juice.

- Parameters
    - Enzyme: pectinase 0.1–0.3%
    - Temp: 40–50 °C enzyme contact, then 2–4 °C
    - Time: 2–12 h
- Goal
    - Visual: brilliant clarity
    - Aroma: intact top notes

- Test
    - Variable: enzyme % and contact time
    - Observe: clarity (NTU), aroma retention, color
    - Acceptance: NTU low, no oxidation after 24 h
- Uses
    - Veg: clarified tomato water
    - Meat: pork glaze base with apple
    - Fish: raw shellfish dressings
    - Dessert: fruit glass gels
