Foaming 

2. Basic Foam Recipe (Without Lecithin)

(Using aquafaba or egg yolk instead)

Ingredients:
	•	150 ml vegetable or flavored liquid (e.g., carrot extract, parsley extract)
	•	30 ml aquafaba (or 1 small egg yolk for rich foams)
	•	1–2% salt, sugar, or acid to balance

Method:
	1.	Blend your liquid with aquafaba or egg yolk until lightly foamy.

Substitutions:
	•	Carrot, parsley, beetroot, basil oil, tomato water, etc. — all work — same base quantities.
