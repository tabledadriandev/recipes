# Koji inoculation on rice

Applications: Amino paste, shoyu base, tenderizing
Confidence: 80
Corrections: Stir to vent heat, reduce bed depth, dry surface
Failure modes: Overheating, sour smell, patchy growth
Medium: Air
Notes: Use polished short-grain for even growth.
Sensory cue: Sweet chestnut aroma, mycelium mat
Source: In-house
Standardized: No
Temperature range (°C): 28–32
Time range: 36–48 h
Tools used: Incubator, trays, hygrometer
Type: Fermentation

### Method

1) Inoculate steamed rice (0.1–0.3% spores) and spread bed 2–4 cm. 2) Incubate 28–32 °C, RH 60–70%; turn every 6–12 h. 3) Finish at sweet chestnut aroma and uniform white mat (36–48 h).

### Notes

- Sensory: sweet chestnut, warm cereal; no sourness. Keep core ≤33 °C.
- Test: bed depth and inoculum %; acceptance = uniform mat by 36–40 h.
- Uses: amino paste, shoyu base, tenderizing.
