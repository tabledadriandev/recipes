# Cylindre de Nori au Tartare de Bœuf #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #AmuseBouche #Advanced

**Preface:** An advanced amuse-bouche, combining the crisp structure of a deep-fried nori cylinder with a classic, precisely seasoned beef tartare.

**Ingredients**

- **Nori Cylinder Batter:**

  - 50 g chicken broth

  - 25 g Sanbaizu (Japanese vinegar dressing)

  - 25 g all-purpose flour

  - 3 nori sheets (cut into 12 rectangles)

  - 2 g green curry paste

  - 1 g fine salt

  - 0.5 g garlic powder

- **Steak Tartare:**

  - 200 g beef tenderloin (finely diced)

  - 20 g Ligurian olive oil

  - 8 g shallot (finely chopped)

  - 4 g Worcestershire sauce

  - 4 g Sanbaizu

  - 3 g fine salt

  - 8 grinds black pepper

- **Sanbaizu Shallot Cream:**

  - 300 g shallots (finely chopped)

  - 100 g vegetable stock

  - 70 g Sanbaizu

  - 3 g fine salt

  - Xanthan gum (knife tip)

- **Finish:** Licorice brunoise cubes

**Method**

1. **Cylinder:** Blend all batter ingredients (except nori) until smooth. Cut nori into 12 rectangles. Brush the batter thinly onto the nori. Wrap the nori, batter-side down, around oiled metal cylinders, using extra batter to seal the edge. Deep-fry at 160°C until golden and crisp. Gently remove the nori from the cylinders while hot. Dehydrate at 50°C for 1 hour to remove residual moisture.

2. **Shallot Cream:** Caramelize the shallots with salt until deeply coloured. Deglaze with vegetable stock and Sanbaizu. Reduce until almost dry. Blend until smooth. Introduce a knife tip of xanthan gum and blend for 1 minute to stabilize.

3. **Tartare:** Dice the tenderloin precisely. Combine with all tartare ingredients. Mix gently and chill.

4. **Plating:** Place the cylinders on the plate. Fill with the chilled steak tartare. Pipe small, disciplined dots of shallot cream onto the surface. Finish with three small cubes of licorice brunoise.

**Technical Notes:** The low-temperature dehydration of the nori cylinder is essential for achieving a lasting, brittle crispness.

**Chef’s Intention:** A technically demanding amuse-bouche that contrasts the crispness of the sea with the richness of the land.
