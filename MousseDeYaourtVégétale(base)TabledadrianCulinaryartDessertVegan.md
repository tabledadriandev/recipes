# Mousse de Yaourt Végétale (Base) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Dessert #Vegan

**Preface:** A light, versatile mousse base, designed for plant-forward desserts, utilizing hydrocolloids and vegan chocolate for a stable, creamy structure.• 210 g whipped cream (see above)

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 500 g yogurt (dairy or plant-based)

  - 300 g white chocolate (dairy-free for vegan)

  - 210 g whipped cream (whipped coconut cream for vegan)

  - 170 g heavy cream (whipped coconut cream for vegan)

  - 8 g Tara gum (or modified starch)

  - 7 gelatin sheets (or 6 g agar-agar powder for vegan)

**Method**

1. In a saucepan, combine the yogurt, Tara gum (or starch), and heavy cream. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring continuously.

2. Remove from heat. Introduce the white chocolate (or dairy-free alternative) and stir until completely melted and homogenous.

3. If using gelatin, dissolve the sheets and incorporate. If using agar-agar, boil the liquid for 10 seconds to activate.

4. Chill the mixture until it begins to set (approximately 30 minutes).

5. Gently fold in the whipped cream (or whipped coconut cream) until the mousse is light and aerated.

6. Pipe into molds or verrines and chill for a minimum of 2 hours to set completely.

**Technical Notes:** The combination of Tara gum and white chocolate provides the necessary stabilization and richness for a dairy-free mousse structure.

**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, light dessert component that offers a refined, plant-based finish to a tasting menu.
