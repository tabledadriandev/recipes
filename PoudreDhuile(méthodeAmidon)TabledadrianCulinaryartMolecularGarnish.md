# Poudre d'Huile (Méthode Amidon) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Garnish

**Preface:** A simple, non-maltodextrin method for transforming flavoured oil into a fine, concentrated powder using cornstarch as the absorbent medium.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 30 g flavoured oil (e.g., chlorophyll oil, carrot oil)

  - 10–15 g cornstarch

**Method**

1. In a chilled bowl, slowly drizzle the flavoured oil into the cornstarch while stirring continuously.

2. Continue mixing until the oil is fully absorbed and the mixture achieves a fine, powdery texture.

3. Adjust the powderiness by introducing tiny, disciplined amounts of extra cornstarch if necessary.

4. Sift the powder lightly to remove any lumps.

5. Store in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption.

**Technical Notes:** The cornstarch acts as a carrier, encapsulating the oil molecules to create a dry, concentrated fat powder.

**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, textural garnish that provides a concentrated burst of flavour and fat on the palate.

**Metadata:**

- Season: All

- Ingredient: Oil

- Dish Type: Garnish\
  **Pairing Suggestion:** A dry, earthy red wine.
