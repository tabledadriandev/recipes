## Method

1. • For smooth, regularly shaped items, use a large ladle and nap them with a single smooth stroke, as illus-trated in Figure 29.1. Working too slowly may produce an uneven, bumpy coat.
2. • Large items and items with steep sides or irregular shapes are harder to coat. Using a ladle, coat the sides first and then the top for best results.
3. • For small items, it may be more convenient to use a kitchen spoon than a ladle.
4. • A pastry brush can be used to coat small items. A brush is often used for small portions, such as canapés, that need only a light glaze rather than a perfectly smooth coating of aspic.
5. 5. Chill the items until the jelly is thoroughly set.
6. 6. Repeat with additional coats, if necessary, until the aspic is of the desired thickness.

14. 1. If the jelly is congealed, it must first be melted. Set the pan or container of jelly in a hot-water bath. Stir it gently from time to time until it is completely melted.
15. 2. Place the warm aspic jelly in a stainless-steel bowl.
16. 3. At all times, be careful not to make any bubbles. Bubbles in the jelly may get transferred to the surface of your food item and mar its appearance.
17. 5. Continue to rotate the bowl until the jelly is thick and syrupy but not yet set. The jelly is now ready for use. Remove from the ice bath and work quickly, because it will set very fast.
18. 6. Remelt and recool the jelly as necessary.
