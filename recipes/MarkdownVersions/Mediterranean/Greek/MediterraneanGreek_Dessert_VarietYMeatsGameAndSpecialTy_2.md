4. open and skewer them to hold them open during cooking.
5. Veal kidneys can be broiled like lamb kidneys, but they are most often cut up, sautéed, and
6. served in a sauce. to prepare them for sautéing, first split them in half. r emove the white ducts from
7. the center. then cut into large dice or thick slices.
8. there are two main pitfalls to cooking kidneys. First, they become tough and rubbery if over -
9. cooked. Properly cooked, they are pink in the middle and still tender and juicy. Cooking time is
10. second, they have a high moisture content, which can interfere with proper sautéing. m ake
11. sure the pan is very hot before adding the kidneys, and do not overcrowd the pan. Failure to do this results in kidneys that are boiled in their juices rather than sautéed.
12. to avoid overcooking when sautéing over high heat, do not try to brown the kidneys too

24. 4. Press between two trays, with a light weight on top, and refrigerate for several hours. if desired,
25. wrap in cheesecloth before pressing, as shown in Figure 16.20.
26. 5. Prepare for cooking:
27. • For braising, leave whole or cut into large dice.
28. • For breading and sautéing, split in half horizontally. Pass through s tandard Breading
