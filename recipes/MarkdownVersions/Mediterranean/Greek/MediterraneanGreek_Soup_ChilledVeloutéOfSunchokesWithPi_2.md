## Method

1. 1.

3. 2.
4. Peel and cut the largest sunchoke into 10 thin slices, dropping the slices into the acidulated water as they are cut. This will prevent them from turning brown.
5. 3.
6. Cut an 8-inch square of cheesecloth and mound the pickling spices in the center of the square. Bring the corners of the cloth together and tie the sachet with kitchen string.
7. 4.
8. Combine the syrup and vinegar in a medium-sized glass or ceramic bowl. Drain the sunchoke slices and add to the bowl along with the spice sachet. Season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.

10. Remove and discard the sachet and drain the sunchoke slices before serving.

12. Fill a large nonreactive bowl with water and add the remaining lemon juice to make acidulated water.
13. 7.
14. Peel and coarsely dice the remaining 6 sunchokes, dropping the dice into the acidulated water as they are cut.
15. 8.
16. Combine the cream and vegetable stock in a large saucepan. Drain and add the sunchoke dice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the sunchokes are tender.
17. 9.
18. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. You will have to do this in batches. Strain the batches through a
