## Method

1. is the Danish word for “food”), a gathering of a few hundred people with a vested interest in seeing the food world get better: people from the restaurant trade, along with scientists, farmers, philosophers, and artists. We chose the theme “Planting Thoughts,” and we began thinking of potential speakers who could bring diverse thoughts about the plant kingdom.
2. I’ll be honest with you: David Chang immediately came to mind because of kimchi. He may not remember serving it, but I remember having an oyster topped with kimchi water at Momofuku Ssäm Bar and finding it absolutely incredible. He and his team were working a parallel track to our own, learning their way around fermentation and developing new products using age-old techniques. I asked him to come speak at MAD about fermentation. While onstage, he introduced the culinary community to the concept of
3. Chang was referring to the largely unseen world of mold, yeast, and bacteria responsible for fermentation. They are omnipresent, transcending countless cultures and culinary traditions. What Chang was saying was that the microbes indigenous to any given region will always have their say in the flavor of the final product, in the same way that soil, weather, and geography affect wine.
4. At the time, people were talking about Noma as the restaurant responsible for defining modern Nordic cuisine. From our perspective, we felt saddled with a tremendous responsibility. How could we claim to be cooking Nordic food if we used techniques from abroad? The notion of microbial terroir helped change everything for us. Fermentation knows no borders. It’s as much a part of the cooking tradition in Denmark as it is in Italy or Japan or China. Without fermentation, there is no kimchi, no fluffy sourdough bread, no Parmigiano, no wine or beer or spirits, no pickles, no soy sauce. There is no pickled herring or rye bread. Without fermentation, there is no Noma.
5. People have always associated our restaurant closely with wild food and foraging, but the truth is that the defining pillar of Noma is fermentation. That’s not to say that our food is especially funky or salty or sour or any of the other tastes that people associate with fermentation. It’s not like that. Try to picture French cooking without wine, or Japanese cuisine without shoyu and miso. It’s the same for us when we think about our own food. My hope is that even if you’ve never eaten at Noma, by the time you’ve finished reading this book and made a few of the recipes, you’ll know what I mean. Fermentation isn’t responsible for one specific taste at Noma-it’s responsible for improving everything.
6. It was with that in mind that in 2014 I asked Lars Williams and Arielle Johnson to build a space dedicated to exploring fermentation. Lars was one of our longest-tenured chefs, and Arielle became our resident scientist in 2013 while finishing her PhD in flavor chemistry. The two of them were responsible for taking our efforts to the next level, turning fermentation into a pursuit of its own at Noma-almost completely separate from the day-to-day activities of running the restaurant.
7. I was inspired by what the chefs at El Bulli had done in separating the actual creative part of their work from the service kitchen. Research and development weren’t just activities to be done in between preparing mise en place and cooking for service. There was a team dedicated to them. That changed the game for creative cooking, and that’s what we wanted to do for fermentation at Noma.
8. During the summer break at Noma, Lars and Arielle began planning what their ideal fermentation lab would include (within reason, of course). Up until then, we’d been fermenting wherever we could-on the boat, in the rafters of adjacent buildings, in old refrigerators, under desks.
9. They came back after a week or two and said the cheapest and most efficient way to do it would be in shipping containers. Things came together quickly. One day, three huge containers came in by forklift and crane. The team insulated the interiors and put up walls and doors. Lars went to Ikea, bought the second-cheapest kitchen, and merged it with equipment we’d amassed over the past decade. We started planning in June or July, and by August we had our fermentation lab.
10. I mention all this because I don’t want to over-romanticize fermentation. It can be a pain in the ass to get everything up and running. It’s work, but it’s incredibly gratifying work. It’s actually an amazing feeling to wait for something to ferment. It runs totally contrary to the spirit of the modern day.
11. And once you have your first ferments, it makes cooking so much easier. I really mean that. Some of these ferments are like a perfect cross between MSG, lemon juice, sugar, and salt. They can be drizzled onto cooked greens, added to soups, or blended into sauces. You can smear lacto-fermented plums onto cooked meats, or use the juice to dress raw seafood. And homemade ferments, packed into glass jars, make for unique and impressive gifts. Once you integrate these ingredients into your cooking, your eating life is going to be irreversibly better.
12. David Zilber started working with us the same year we built the fermentation lab. He came to us as a cook from Canada, and started in the restaurant as a chef de partie. When Lars and Arielle were leaving Noma in 2016, I was a bit distraught that we’d have to find someone to take over their work in the lab. But our head chef at the time, Dan Giusti, said we wouldn’t have to look far. We installed David as the head of the fermentation lab, and it’s been a perfect fit. He has an incredibly quick mind and an insatiable curiosity. He understands the science underlying fermentation, and brings a line cook’s work ethic to its practice. If you ask him something he doesn’t know the answer to, rest assured he’ll be completely educated about it the next time you talk to him. He’s like a machine designed specifically to write this book with me.
13. And it’s important to me that this book exist. It’s important that we document the good work that people have done here. But I’m most excited by the prospect of people taking that work and applying it outside the restaurant. We’ve written books before, but none where the main goal was to translate what we do in the restaurant to a home kitchen. It’s exhilarating to think that people all around the world will be able to get a sense for how we cook at Noma.
14. That’s the only possible next step for what we’ve been working on this past decade. Restaurants have influenced what’s sold on grocery store shelves. They’ve invigorated tourism in regions like ours, where people would never have thought to come eat before. The next phase is more education and more cooking-people connecting what we do at top-level restaurants with their everyday lives. That’s how we can create a completely new culture of eating.
15. At this point, the rate of discovery in the fermentation lab has slowed. We continue to adapt techniques to different ingredients, and some ferments remain less explored than others, but we’re not stumbling into eye-opening new products at the same pace. When you’ve made garums (ancient fish sauces you’ll learn all about later) from every type of seafood in Scandinavia, and they’ve all been good, it becomes difficult to identify the nuances. By putting this knowledge out there, we’re hoping that not only will readers experience the same joy of discovery as we have, but that we’ll get something out of it, too. We hope this will spur on the field. Perhaps one of you will take what you’ve learned here and come up with something completely new. If we’re lucky, that will come back to Noma and bolster us.
16. I believe in fermentation wholeheartedly, not only as a way to unlock flavors, but also as a way of making food that feels good to eat. People argue over the correlation between fermented foods and an active gut health. But there’s no denying that I personally feel better eating a diet full of fermented products. When I was growing up, eating at the best restaurants meant feeling sick and full for days, because supposedly everything tasty had to be fatty, salty, and sugary. I dream about the restaurants of the future, where you go not just for an injection of new flavors and experiences, but for something that’s really positive for your mind and body.
17. The broth is made by braising sea snails in an oil made from dried koji, then combining the cooking liquid with seaweed stock and more oil. It’s served in the shell, garnished with pickled herbs.
18. I hope this book can be a launching pad for home cooks and restaurant cooks alike. When we think of our ideal readers, David and I talk equally about the parent who’s passionate about cooking for his or her family and doesn’t mind a weekend project, as well as the professional cook or sous-chef who can read between the lines and pull out novel ideas.
19. Studying the science and history of fermentation, learning to do it ourselves, adapting it to local ingredients, and cooking with the results changed everything at Noma. Once you’ve done the same and have these incredible products at your disposal-whether it’s lacto-fermented fruit, barley miso, koji, or a roasted chicken wing garum-cooking gets easier while your food becomes more complex, nuanced, and delicious.
