## Method

1. fuss mix of a soft dough with a small amount of yeast in the evening; shaping into loaves
2. the next morning; and baking in a Dutch oven an hour or two later. However, when you
3. compare our ingredient ratios using baker’s percentages, or when you compare the
4. specified water temperatures, it’s easy to see the differences. In terms of ingredients, my
5. water temperature is at least 30°F (about 16°C) warmer, resulting in a final mix
6. temperature that’s about 18°F (10°C) warmer. As for differences in technique, I call for
7. an autolyse period and I specify applying two folds, preferably in the first hour and a
8. half after mixing the dough. My recipe takes a little bit more work, but not much.
9. I write this comparison to Mr. Lahey’s well-known bread recipe to show that the
10. recipes’ baker’s percentages, temperatures, and timelines. Seeing that my bread, which
11. is made on the same schedule, uses one-third the amount of yeast and is mixed with much
12. and the temperature of the dough. My dough benefits from a few folds to give it strength.
