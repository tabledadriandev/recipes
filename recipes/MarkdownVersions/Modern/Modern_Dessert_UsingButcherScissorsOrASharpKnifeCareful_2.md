## Method

1. Remove the small legs from the bottom part of the head -you should have 6. On a cutting
2. toward the top of the leg where you disconnected it from the body. This pressing and rolling
3. technique will push the leg meat out from each leg. Be delicate with these pieces of meat to ensure that they stay whole.
4. claws, 2 knuckles, 6 small legs, and 1 head. Aside from the head, brush each piece with fresh barle y koji butter and reserve in the fridge until service.
5. outside of the fridge for at least 1 hour. Set a steam oven to 68°C, and place 1 portion of the broken -down langoustine meat in its covered container in the steam er to warm through.
6. Fill a saucepot with butter and bring it to 95°C. In service, place the langoustine tail into the butter when it reaches this temperature. If you are cooking more than 1 langoustine tail at a time, be careful not to drop the temperatur e of the butter by cooling it down with too many
7. tails-we want to cook the tails at 95°C. Cook the tail at temperature for 3 minutes (this time
8. can vary depending on the size of the tails). The tails should be medium -rare, with a rainbow
9. shine in the middl e-if they are overcooked, the texture can become rubbery. Once cooked,
