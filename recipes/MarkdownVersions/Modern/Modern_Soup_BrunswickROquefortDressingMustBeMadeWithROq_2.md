## Method

1. Billing a pan-fried item as “roasted” because it sounds better on the menu misrepresents the
2. item and risks disappointing the customer.
3. 4. “Fresh.”
4. if you call something fresh, it must be fresh, not frozen, canned, or dried. there is no such thing
5. 5. Origin.chefs and restaurateurs who champion local food sources and farm-to-table cuisine () often
6. include the sources of ingredients, such as names of farms, on the menu. i t is essential that
7. the sources listed be accurate. similarly, an item labeled imported must come from outside
8. the country. Better and more specific than using the term imported is to indicate the country
9. 6. “Homemade.”
10. the word homemade means the item was made on the premises. a dding a few fresh carrots
11. to canned vegetable soup does not make it homemade.
12. 7. “Organic.”
13. sewage. i n some countries, including the united s tates, the use of the word organic on labels
14. 8. Size or portion.
15. if you indicate a portion size on the menu, be sure you serve that size (within allowable toler -
16. ances). a “10-ounce steak” must weigh at least 10 ounces before cooking. “Jumbo shrimp” are
17. not just big shrimp. they are a specific size.
18. 9. Appearance.
19. Family-style restaurants that use illustrated menus should serve food that looks like the illus -
20. trations. i f an illustration of a shrimp plate shows six shrimp, it would be a mistake to serve
21. Listing “maple syrup” and serving maple-flavored syrup.
22. Listing “butter” and serving margarine.
23. Listing coffee or breakfast cereal “with cream” and serving milk or artificial cream.Listing “ground round” and serving other ground beef.
24. Finally, please use a dictionary. unfortunately, it is common to see menus full of misspellings.
25. these errors reflect poorly on the restaurant. c ustomers may think that if you don’t care enough
26. either. i f you use terms from French, i talian, or another language, make sure the terms are spelled
