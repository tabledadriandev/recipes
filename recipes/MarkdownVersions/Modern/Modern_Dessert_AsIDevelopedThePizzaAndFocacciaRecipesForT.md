## Method

1. oven with a pizza stone. I landed on the technique of placing the pizza stone in the upper
2. third of the oven and using a combination of baking and broiling. I was fascinated by
3. how good the pizza baked. I hope you get similar results.
4. Preheating
5. inches below the broiler. Preheat the oven to the highest heat setting possible; most home
6. ovens only go up to 500°F or 525°F (260°C or 274°C). If you have a pizza oven that
7. goes higher, I recommend making your first pizzas at 600°F (316°C). Save the super-
8. high-temperature baking until after you’ve done this a few times. Also, keep in mind that
9. every oven bakes differently, so pay attention and get the best using what you have.
10. Once the oven has reached the target temperature, continue heating the pizza stone for
11. to 30 minutes, switching to the broil setting for the last 5 or so minutes. This ensures
12. that the pizza stone will be thoroughly saturated with heat before baking. Then turn the
13. setting back to bake, put your pizza in the oven, and bake for 5 minutes at about 525°F
14. (274°C). Change the setting back to broil and then give your pizza about 2 more minutes;
15. the broiler should finish the top of your pie. This technique should produce an excellent
16. crust. Keep a pair of tongs handy to pull the pizza from the pizza stone and onto a plate.

18. breaker (unmarked, naturally). I didn’t kill-or even injure-the oven, happily. On my
19. second try I went with just 3 minutes on broil before returning to bake mode, and Mr.
20. Oven was okay with that. I mention this because every home pizza baker needs to find a
21. way to tweak their oven to get the highest possible heat without damaging it. I’m sure
22. the temperature reached higher than the highest bake setting.
23. pizza stone about 8 inches below the broiler coil. Switching to broil for a few minutes
24. before baking (if your oven can handle it!), helps to superheat the pizza stone just before
25. wood-fired oven at my pizzeria. The reason I call for broiling again at the end of the
26. pizza’s baking time is to finish the top of the pizza with very high heat to simulate, as
