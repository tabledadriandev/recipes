## Method

2. his dishes. I was inspired by the honesty, the attention
3. Gavroche. Albert taught me the proper use of extra-
4. control me. He’s been like a father figure to me over the
5. years. He had time for me and tried to understand me
6. I went to Nico next. In fact I went to Nico for £50 in
7. evenings. I didn’t stop still, I didn’t have time for sleep
8. working, thinking. I still don’t.
9. Nico is the true gourmet. I’ve never met anyone who
10. had as much appreciation of food as Nico does. He loves
11. eating. If he hadn’t been a great chef he would have been
12. the most knowledgeable and respected food journalist.
