## Method

1. rice, although it has a longer cooking time.
2. Oats are most familiar in n orth a merica as a breakfast food. Steel-cut oats are whole grains
3. that have been cut into small pieces, somewhat resembling cracked wheat. they are usually cooked
4. as a porridge. Rolled oats are whole grains that have been steamed until soft and then flattened
5. between rollers. this processing reduces their cooking time considerably. if they are cooked and
6. not just softened during the steaming process, they become instant oats. these need no additional
7. cooking, only reconstituting with boiling water.
8. Millet is a small, round yellow grain that is an important food source in much of a frica and a sia.
9. it has a high protein content and a mild flavor. m illet is often used as bird seed in north a merica.
10. become a common feature of north a merican menus. Quinoa is high in
11. good-quality protein and lower in carbohydrates than other grains. i t is
12. a tiny, round grain with an ivory color and a mild, delicate flavor. When cooked, the germ of the grain unwinds, making it look as though each
13. grain has a tail. Before cooking, quinoa must be washed and rinsed well to remove a bitter coating that occurs naturally on the grain.
14. Triticale is a high-protein hybrid of wheat and rye. i t is often ground

16. flavor when cooked. i t contains high-quality protein and thus is useful in

18. of omega-3 fatty acids (). the seeds are used mostly in small
19. consuming them in large quantities can cause digestive problems.
20. out moisture and insects. milled grains such as white rice that have had the germ removed will keep
21. for many months. Whole grains are somewhat more perishable because the fat content of the germ can become rancid.
22. depending on the source, whole grains may need to be picked over like dried beans (see )
23. to remove foreign matter such as tiny stones or bits of soil. i n addition, whole grains usually should
24. be washed and drained before cooking.
25. rice, our most commonly cooked grain, should be rinsed in cold water before boiling or steam -
26. ing. this removes the excess starch that makes it sticky. the rice industry recommends not washing
27. rice because it removes some of the vitamin coating of enriched rice. But that’s probably a small price to pay for a more attractive product. this is a decision you will have to make in your own operation.
28. do not buy low-grade rice, which tends to be dirty, or rice that has been coated with talc.
29. the fat coating each kernel helps keep the grains separate and reduces stickiness.
30. converted rice and instant rice do not need to be washed.
