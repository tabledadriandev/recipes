## Method

1. Veal sweetbreads, which are recognized by most as superior to lamb sweetbreads, are just about my favorite food. Cooked correctly, they are crunchy on the outside and moist and creamy on the inside. Find a good butcher and buy those that are encased in a firm, glossy membrane. The thymus glands naturally have one elongated and one rounder lobe-both with the same rich flavor and luxurious texture. Soak the sweetbreads first in milk and then take care not to overcook them. They’re earthy, lusty fare-perfect, I think, with wild mushrooms. If you’ve never cooked them before, a small amuse is a good place to start.
2. ¼ cup chopped shiitake mushrooms
3. ¼ cup chopped black trumpet or chanterelle mushrooms
4. ¼ cup chopped lobster, hedgehog, or cremini mushrooms
5. ¼ cup chopped oyster mushrooms
6. cup coarsely chopped toasted pecans
7. 1.
8. Soak the sweetbreads in milk in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours.
9. 2.
10. Lift the sweetbreads from the milk and rinse under cold water. Fill a medium-sized deep skillet about halfway with water and bring the water to a simmer. Add the sweetbreads and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes. Lift from the water with a slotted spoon.
11. 3.
12. Pat the sweetbreads dry. Trim off any visible fat, membranes, and sinews. Cut them into bite-sized pieces.

14. Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and thyme and sauté for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mushrooms are lightly browned and softened.
15. 5.
16. Remove the pan from the heat and discard the sprigs of thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the mushrooms with the pecans and set aside, covered, to keep warm.

18. Meanwhile, pour the vegetable oil into a medium-sized deep heavy saucepan to a depth of 2 inches. Heat over high heat until hot and a deep-frying thermometer registers 350°F.
19. 7.
20. Fry the sweetbreads, in batches, for 5 to 8 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon or spider. Drain quickly on paper towels; do not allow the sweetbreads to cool very much. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

22. To serve, divide the sweetbread nuggets among 6 small plates. Spoon red wine sauce around the sweetbreads and top each portion with sautéed wild mushrooms.
