## Method

1. 5.
2. Put the chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl that will fit over a small saucepan. Set aside. Fill the bottom of the double boiler or the saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil; turn off the heat. Place the chocolate over the hot water and let stand for a few seconds or until the chocolate starts to melt. Stir until completely melted. Add the water to thin out the sauce if desired. Keep warm.

4. Unwrap the venison and cut 12 paper-thin slices from the meat. If you have an electric meat slicer, use it. Otherwise, use a sharp knife. If the meat is too hard to slice, let it thaw for a few minutes. As soon as it’s sliced, it will begin to thaw, so it will be at the perfect temperature when served.

6. To serve, use a pastry brush to paint a small amount of chocolate sauce on each of 6 small plates. Arrange 2 slices of venison over the sauce and garnish each serving with Champagne grapes. Drizzle the venison with dill oil.
