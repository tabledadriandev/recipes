# High-Leverage Tips and Tricks (Noma 2.0)

## Bag Management

- If lacto bags balloon, crack open and reseal; keep at 28 °C.

## Clarification

- **Freeze-thaw clarification**: Freeze juices, hang to drip 48–72 h; **no pressing**.

## pH Discipline

- Target **pH ≈ 3.5** for kombucha.

- Target **pH ≈ 4.3** for acidified truffle juice.

- Target **pH ≤ 4.5** for lacto-koji water.

## Oil Preservation

- After fine-straining infused oils, **vacuum-seal and freeze** to slow rancidity/oxidation.

## Filtration

- For tannic botanicals (sumac), pass through a **moistened towel** after the sieve to remove fines.

## Combi Specifics

- **Confit**: Use “Forced steam” at **130 °C** to confit in oil without browning.

- **Preservation**: Use **100 °C full steam** to safely heat-process acidified jars.
