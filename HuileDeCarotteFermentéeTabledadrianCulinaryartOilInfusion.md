# Huile de Carotte Fermentée #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Oil #Infusion

**Preface:** A vibrant, aromatic oil, utilizing controlled fermentation and low-temperature infusion to extract and deepen the carrot's natural pigment and flavour profile.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 100 g neutral sunflower oil

  - 50 g grated carrots

**Method**

1. Grate the carrots finely to maximize surface area.

2. Combine the grated carrots and neutral oil. Heat the mixture to precisely 80°C.

3. Transfer the mixture to a vacuum-seal bag and seal.

4. Confit the oil in a _sous-vide_ bath at 65°C for 24–72 hours.

5. Blend the oil and carrots until smooth. Strain through a fine cheesecloth.

6. Transfer the oil to a piping bag and allow it to rest in the refrigerator to separate the oil from any residual water or purée. Discard the bottom water and residue. Store the clarified oil in an airtight container.

**Technical Notes:** The _sous-vide_ confit at 65°C ensures maximum beta-carotene extraction while preserving the oil's integrity.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A concentrated, earthy oil that provides a disciplined accent of colour and aroma to a savoury plate.\
