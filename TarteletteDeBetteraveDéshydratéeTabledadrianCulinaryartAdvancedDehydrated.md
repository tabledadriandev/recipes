# Tartelette de Betterave Déshydratée #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Advanced #Dehydrated

**Preface:** An advanced, dehydrated crisp, utilizing concentrated beetroot purée to form a fragile, intensely flavoured shell for a savoury composition.

**Ingredients**

- **Cooked Beetroots:**

  - 1.2 beetroots

  - Ligurian olive oil

  - Fine salt

  - 0.8 sprigs thyme (Provence)

- **Tartelette Base:**

  - 45 g cooked beetroot

  - 12 g isomalt sugar

  - 3 g egg white

  - 2 g glucose

  - 0.4 g fine salt

  - 0.4 g xanthan gum powder

**Method**

1. **Cooked Beetroots:** Place beets on parchment paper. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and thyme. Wrap tightly to create an airtight package. Bake at 180°C for 100 minutes. Cool, peel, and cut into large chunks.

2. **Tartelette:** Blend the cooked beetroot with egg white, isomalt, glucose, salt, and xanthan gum until perfectly smooth.

3. Spread the mixture thinly onto a silicone sheet using a circular stencil. Remove the stencil.

4. Dehydrate at 80°C for 3–4 hours until completely dry and brittle.

5. Gently remove the discs. Place them one by one onto a tartelette mold. Heat again for 30 seconds to soften, then press the top to shape the crisp.

6. Cool and store dry.

**Technical Notes:** The combination of isomalt and xanthan gum provides the necessary structure for the beetroot purée to set into a brittle, dehydrated shell.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A technically demanding component that provides a concentrated, earthy sweetness and a fragile texture.\
