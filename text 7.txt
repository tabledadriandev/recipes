Replacements 

1. How to Replace Maltodextrin

What maltodextrin does:
	•	It absorbs fats (like oils) and turns them into a fine powder.
	•	It’s neutral in flavor.

If you don’t have it, replace it with:

Replacement	How to Use	Note
Tapioca maltodextrin (sometimes sold under different names)	Same way as normal maltodextrin	Check if sold in health shops as a gluten-free thickener
Cornstarch (maizena)	Blend lightly with oil	Works OK but doesn’t create ultra-fine powder, and can be slightly starchy in taste. Only use a small amount.
Powdered sugar (unsweetened if possible)	Mix carefully with oil	In emergency cases, but taste will be sweet — better for sweet dishes
Freeze-dried powders	Soak oil into already freeze-dried ingredients (e.g., freeze-dried carrots)	More natural, but not the same texture
Aerosil (Silicon dioxide)	Professional kitchens use this for oil powders	Hard to find unless buying pro-grade supplies

Summary:
	•	Best substitute for maltodextrin: cornstarch (for savory) or powdered sugar (for sweet) — but quality won’t be as fine.
	•	Or: focus on making oil gels instead of powders if you can’t powder it.

2. How to Replace Sodium Alginate

What sodium alginate does:
	•	It’s used for spherification (forming pearls and spheres).
	•	Needs a calcium bath to gel.

If you don’t have it, replace it with:

Replacement	How to Use	Note
Agar-Agar	Create gelled cubes, purées, or strips	Not pearls — but can cut gels into tiny bead shapes manually
Gelatin sheets	Make gels, then scoop into pearls manually	Needs cold setting, not vegetarian
Pectin (from apples/citrus)	Make soft gels	Softer texture, less bouncy than alginate spheres
Gellan gum	If you can find it, it can create small gel spheres	Professional kitchens use it for clear spheres

Important:
	•	True liquid-to-liquid spherification (where droplets gel instantly in a bath) only works with alginate-calcium reaction.
	•	Without sodium alginate, you can simulate pearls by making a gel, then cutting or shaping it into mini balls.

Practical Solutions if You Don’t Have Maltodextrin or Sodium Alginate

Situation	What To Do
Want oil powder but no maltodextrin?	Blend oil with a little cornstarch for a sandy texture, or make an oil gel instead.
Want pearls but no sodium alginate?	Make soft agar gels or pectin gels, and cut into tiny spheres manually with a melon baller, piping bag, or knife.

Summary: What you can still create without them

Molecular Technique	Alternative
Oil powders	Cornstarch or natural absorption methods
Pearls/spheres	Agar gels, gelatin pearls, pectin drops
Emulsions, foams	Egg yolk, aquafaba, mustard
Gels	Agar-agar, gelatin, pectin
