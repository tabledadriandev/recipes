# Poudre de Céleri Vert #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Garnish #Dehydrated

**Preface:** A concentrated, savoury powder, achieved through disciplined dehydration to intensify the clean, vegetal essence of celery.• Fresh celery stalks (organic preferred)

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - Fresh celery stalks (organic preferred)

**Method**

1. Clean the celery stalks thoroughly. Pat dry.

2. Slice the stalks into thin, uniform strips or slices to ensure rapid and even drying.

3. **Dehydration:** Dry the slices in a dehydrator at 55–60°C until the stalks are completely brittle and crisp. Alternatively, use a low oven setting with the door ajar.B. Oven (if no dehydrator): Set oven to lowest temp (\~60–80°C). Spread celery on parchment paper in a single layer. Leave oven door ajar slightly. Dry for 4–6 hours, flipping halfway through.

4. Mill the dried celery into a fine powder. Store in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption.

**Technical Notes:** Complete dehydration is essential; any residual moisture will compromise the powder's texture and shelf life.

**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, earthy garnish that provides a concentrated vegetal note and textural contrast.
