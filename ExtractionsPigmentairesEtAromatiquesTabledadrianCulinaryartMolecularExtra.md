# Extractions Pigmentaires et Aromatiques #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Extraction

**Preface:** A reference guide to disciplined culinary extraction, isolating pure pigments and aromatic compounds for precise molecular plating.

**Ingredients**

- **Anthocyanins (Red/Blue):** Red cabbage, blueberries, hibiscus flowers.

- **Lycopene (Red):** Tomatoes, watermelon.

- **Curcumin (Yellow):** Turmeric root.

- **Betalains (Pink/Red):** Beets, Swiss chard stems.

- **Capsaicin (Spicy):** Chili peppers.

- **Essential Aromatics:** Basil, mint, rosemary, thyme.

- **Pectin:** Apples, citrus peels.

**Method**

1. **Aqueous Pigments (Anthocyanins, Betalains):** Blend or juice the source material. Strain finely. Adjust pH with lemon juice to stabilize the desired colour (acid yields red, neutral yields blue).

2. **Oil-Soluble Pigments (Lycopene, Curcumin):** Confit the source material (e.g., tomato paste, turmeric) in neutral oil at 50–80°C. Strain to obtain a concentrated, pigmented oil.

3. **Capsaicin/Aromatics:** Infuse chopped source material in neutral oil at a low, controlled temperature (50–78°C). Strain and clarify.

4. **Pectin:** Simmer citrus peels in water. Reduce the liquid to concentrate the natural gelling agent.

**Technical Notes:** Precise temperature control is paramount for all oil infusions to maximize extraction without compromising the oil's integrity.

**Chef’s Intention:** The isolation of these compounds allows for disciplined control over colour, flavour, and texture in avant-garde compositions.
