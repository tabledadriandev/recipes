# Risotto Printanier à l'Asperge et Prosecco #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Risotto #Savory

**Preface:** A classic Italian risotto, deconstructed into precise components to ensure textural perfection and concentrated flavour.• Risotto

**Ingredients**

- **Asparagus Stock:**

  - 25 asparagus (trimmings)

  - 1 celery stalk (roughly chopped)

  - 1 small onion (skin on, halved)

  - 100 g aged Italian cheese rind (washed)

  - 1 bay leaf

  - Fine salt and pepper (to season)

- **Asparagus Purée:**

  - Asparagus spears (blanched)

  - Ice water

- **Risotto Base:**

  - Carnaroli or Arborio rice

  - Prosecco (dry)

  - Unsalted butter, Parmesan cheese (for _mantecatura_)

**Method**

1. **Stock:** Prepare a quick vegetable stock using the trimmings, celery, onion, bay leaf, and cheese rind. Simmer for 30 minutes. Strain and reserve.

2. **Purée:** Blanch the asparagus spears rapidly in boiling water, then shock immediately in ice water to set the colour. Blend the spears with a small amount of the reserved stock until a smooth, vibrant purée is achieved.

3. **Risotto:** Toast the rice in dry butter. Deglaze with Prosecco. Gradually introduce the hot asparagus stock, stirring continuously.

4. Finish the risotto with the asparagus purée and perform the _mantecatura_ (mounting with butter and Parmesan) off the heat to achieve a creamy, flowing texture.

**Technical Notes:** The _mantecatura_ technique is essential for achieving the characteristic creamy texture of a finished risotto.• Salt to taste\
