Extracts 

1. Anthocyanins (Red, purple, blue pigments)

Sources: Red cabbage, blueberries, blackberries, purple carrots, hibiscus flowers.

Extraction:
	•	Blend or juice the vegetable or fruit.
	•	Strain carefully.
	•	(Optional) Slightly acidify with lemon juice to stabilize the color.

Molecular uses:
	•	Natural color-changing foams and gels (anthocyanins change color depending on pH — blue at neutral, red in acid!).
	•	Beautiful pearls, crystal-clear gels, or drinks.

2. Lycopene (Red pigment)

Sources: Tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, papaya.

Extraction:
	•	Slow-cook tomato paste or watermelon flesh at ~80°C in neutral oil.
	•	Strain to obtain lycopene-infused oil.

Molecular uses:
	•	Bright red oils for plating or spherification.
	•	Red foams or emulsions.

3. Curcumin (Intense yellow pigment)

Sources: Turmeric root.

Extraction:
	•	Blend fresh turmeric with neutral oil.
	•	Warm slightly (~50°C) to infuse.
	•	Strain carefully.

Molecular uses:
	•	Yellow oils, spheres, foams.
	•	Colorant for pastes and sauces.

5. Capsaicin (Spicy molecule)

Sources: Chili peppers.

Extraction:
	•	Infuse chopped chilies in oil (gently at low temperature).
	•	Strain.

Molecular uses:
	•	Create spicy spheres, foams, or edible oils.
	•	Spicy pearls for surprise effects.

7. Pectin and Natural Gelling Agents

Sources: Apples, citrus peels, quince.

Extraction:
	•	Simmer apple or citrus peels in water.
	•	Reduce liquid to concentrate natural pectin.

Molecular uses:
	•	Create natural gels without added agar/gelatin.
	•	Pectin spheres, apple foams, or chewy fruit gels.
