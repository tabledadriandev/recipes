**Preface:** A classic Austrian brioche, prepared in miniature form, characterized by its rich butter content and delicate, airy crumb.• 80 g butter

**Ingredients**

- **Dough:**

  - 500 g all-purpose flour

  - 250 g whole milk

  - 80 g unsalted butter (softened)

  - 60 g granulated sugar

  - 1 whole egg

  - 2 egg yolks

  - 5 g fine salt

  - 10 g fresh yeast

- **Finish:**

  - 50 g melted butter (for glazing)

**Method**

1. Gently warm the milk to 40°C. Dissolve the yeast with one tablespoon of sugar in the warm milk. Allow to activate for 10 minutes.

2. Sift the flour into a stand mixer bowl. Add the milk mixture, egg, yolks, remaining sugar, and salt.

3. Knead the dough for 5–6 minutes. Gradually incorporate the softened butter until the dough is smooth and pulls cleanly from the sides of the bowl.

4. Allow the dough to proof in a warm environment until doubled in volume (approximately 1 hour).

5. Divide the dough into 30g portions. Form into smooth spheres and brush each sphere with melted butter.

6. Arrange the spheres tightly in a baking dish. Allow a second proof for 30 minutes.

7. Bake at 180°C until golden brown. Brush with melted butter immediately upon removal.

**Technical Notes:** The double proofing process is essential for achieving the characteristic light and airy texture of brioche.

**Chef’s Intention:** A comforting, refined bread service that speaks to the heritage of European baking.
