**Preface:** A concise guide to ingredient preparation, ensuring optimal texture and structural integrity across various molecular techniques.

**Ingredients**

- **Juicy Extractions:** Carrot, beetroot, parsley, tomato, blueberry (ideal for thin liquids).

- **Thick Purées:** Pumpkin (must be thinned to juice consistency).

- **Oil Infusions:** Beta-carotene oil (requires cornstarch/maltodextrin for powder).

- **Stabilizers:** Agar-agar, aquafaba.

**MethodThick purées** (like pumpkin) must be thinned to a juice-like consistency before using.• **Oil infusions** (like beta-carotene oil) need cornstarch/maltodextrin or can be used for foams/emulsions.

1. **Liquid Preparation:** Ensure all extracted ingredients are perfectly liquefied, finely strained, and smooth before use in any molecular technique.

2. **Structural Integrity:** As long as the liquid base is prepared with precision, the base ingredient can be swapped freely without compromising the final structure.

3. **Strength Adjustment (Gels):** To increase the firmness of gels, introduce an additional 0.2–0.5 g of agar-agar per 200 g of liquid.

4. **Strength Adjustment (Foams):** To achieve thicker, more stable foams, increase the proportion of aquafaba up to 50 ml per base liquid.

**Technical Notes:** The viscosity of the base liquid is the most critical factor for successful spherification and gelification.

**Chef’s Intention:** This reference ensures disciplined preparation, allowing for creative freedom within a framework of technical precision.
