# EMP Executive Theses (Flavor & Assembly)

- **Flavor Philosophy**: Clarity, depth, and restraint. Flavor is built from stocks, reductions, oils, and ferments.

- **Dish Assembly**: Components > recipes. Each dish is a precise assembly of 3–6 intensely prepared elements.

- **Texture Orchestration**: Each dish should feature one creamy, one crisp, one fresh, and one warm aromatic texture.

- **Acidity**: Acidity finishes the thought. Brighten at the pass, not in the pot.

- **Mise en Place**: Choreography of cold, hot, crunch, and à la minute sauces must align.
