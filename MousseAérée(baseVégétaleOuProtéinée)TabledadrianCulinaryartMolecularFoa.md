# Mousse Aérée (Base Végétale ou Protéinée) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Foam

**Preface:** A light, aerated foam, utilizing the natural protein structure of aquafaba or egg yolk to achieve stability without chemical stabilizers.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 150 ml vegetable or flavoured liquid (e.g., carrot extract, parsley extract)

  - 30 ml aquafaba (for vegan foam) OR 1 small egg yolk (for rich foam)

  - 1–2% salt, sugar, or acid (to balance)

**Method**

1. Combine the flavoured liquid with the chosen protein source (aquafaba or egg yolk).

2. Blend the mixture using an immersion blender until a light, stable foam is achieved.

3. For a stronger, more disciplined foam, transfer the mixture to a siphon and charge with one N2O cartridge.

4. Dispense and serve immediately.

**Technical Notes:** The mechanical action of blending or the pressure from the siphon is used to incorporate air into the protein matrix, creating a stable, light texture.

**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, ephemeral texture that provides an aromatic lift to the final plating.

**Metadata:**

- Season: All

- Ingredient: Protein

- Dish Type: Component\
  **Pairing Suggestion:** A light, herbal infusion.
