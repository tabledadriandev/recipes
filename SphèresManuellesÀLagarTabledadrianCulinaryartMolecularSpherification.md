# Sphères Manuelles à l'Agar #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Molecular #Spherification

**Preface:** A technique for creating firm, uniform spheres from pure liquid, utilizing agar-agar for a stable, non-elastic gel structure.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 200 g vegetable juice or extraction (e.g., parsley, carrot, beetroot)

  - 2 g agar-agar powder (1% of liquid weight)

  - Pinch of salt or sugar (to balance)

**Method**

1. Bring the seasoned juice to a rapid boil.

2. Whisk in the agar-agar powder.

3. Boil for 10–15 seconds to fully activate the agar.

4. Cool the liquid slightly to 60–70°C.

5. Using a pipette or syringe, drop the warm liquid into a chilled neutral oil bath.

6. The liquid will set instantly into spheres upon contact with the cold oil.

7. Strain the spheres from the oil and rinse gently in cold water before service.

**Technical Notes:** The rapid cooling in the oil bath is the mechanism for setting the agar, creating a firm sphere without the need for a calcium bath.\
**Chef’s Intention:** A disciplined, textural element that provides a concentrated burst of flavour on the palate.\
