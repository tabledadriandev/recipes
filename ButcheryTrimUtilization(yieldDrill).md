# Butchery & Trim Utilization (Yield Drill)

## Goal

Minimize waste and understand real cost.

## Practice: Whole Product Breakdown

1. Break down a chicken or a fish completely.

2. Separate trim: bones → stock, skin → crisp, fat → render, meat → dish.

3. Log EP yield (% edible) and cost/kg.

4. Next day, repeat with a different cook and compare yields.

## Practice: Red Meat

1. Trim silver skin, weigh waste, record yield % for each muscle.

2. Calculate cost per usable kg after trim.

3. **Decision Point**: That number decides if you buy whole or portioned cuts.
