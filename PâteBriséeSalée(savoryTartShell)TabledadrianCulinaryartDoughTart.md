# Pâte Brisée Salée (Savory Tart Shell) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Dough #Tart

**Preface:** A disciplined, short dough formulated for structural integrity and a subtle, savoury foundation for seasonal fillings.• 15 g egg yolk

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 170 g all-purpose flour

  - 60 g cold water

  - 20 g olive oil (Ligurian)

  - 15 g egg yolk

  - 10 g sugar

  - 3 g fine salt

**Method**

1. Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl. Create a well and introduce the egg yolk, olive oil, and cold water.

2. Mix the ingredients rapidly until a cohesive mass forms; avoid over-kneading.

3. Knead the dough for precisely 5 minutes to achieve a smooth texture.

4. Wrap and chill for 1 hour to allow the butter to firm and the gluten to relax.

5. Roll the dough to the desired thickness, line the tart molds, and chill for 30 minutes before baking at 170°C–180°C until a pale gold colour is achieved.

**Technical Notes:** The chilling periods are essential for preventing shrinkage during the blind-baking process.

**Chef’s Intention:** The shell provides a crisp, neutral counterpoint to the intensity of the seasonal filling.
