Chef/Source: Chef Studio (Modernist cooking content)  
Ingredients: 500 ml fresh orange juice (divided) , 25 g sugar, 30–50 ml lemon juice, 4 g agar agar powder .
Preparation: Pour 250 ml of the orange juice into a saucepan (reserve the other half) . Add the sugar and agar agar to the pan and whisk. Bring to a boil over medium heat and let it boil for 1–2 minutes (boiling activates agar) . Remove from heat. Stir the lemon juice into the uncooked reserved 250 ml of orange juice, then whisk this mixture into the hot liquid – this helps preserve a fresh flavor by not boiling all the juice . Pour the combined mixture into a shallow tray and refrigerate for about 30 minutes until firm. Once gelled, cut into chunks and transfer to a blender. Blitz until completely smooth and glossy, creating a vibrant orange fluid gel . Store in a squeeze bottle. This sweet-tart gel adds a burst of citrus and a beautiful orange swoosh or dots on the plate, perfect for plating desserts or savory dishes (great with duck or salads) .

Liquid Olive Spheres (“Molecular Olives”)

Chef/Source: Ferran Adrià (El Bulli) – The Food Dictator blog  
Ingredients: 200 g high-quality green olive juice (freshly extracted from green olives) , 2 g calcium lactate gluconate (about 1% of juice weight) , 0.75 g xanthan gum . Alginate Bath: 1.5 L water, 7.5 g sodium alginate . Aromatized Olive Oil (for storing spheres): Extra virgin olive oil, with a few sprigs of dill and chervil, a pinch of cracked caraway seed and white peppercorn (let this infuse 24h) .
Preparation: Alginate Bath: Blend sodium alginate into the water using an immersion blender. It will be cloudy; refrigerate 24 hours to clear and remove air bubbles . Olive Base: Blend the olive juice with calcium lactate gluconate. Sprinkle xanthan over the surface and let hydrate for 1 minute, then blend gently to thicken the olive liquid slightly . Chill this olive mixture for 10 minutes; it should be the consistency of a thick sauce that can hold a droplet shape  (add a tiny pinch more xanthan if too thin) . Spherification: Fill a deep spoon (5 mL measuring spoon) with the olive mixture. Gently pour it into the prepared alginate bath . The olive liquid will form a sphere with a thin gel membrane. Ensure spheres do not touch in the bath. Let each sphere “cook” in the alginate solution for about 2½ minutes . Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the sphere and rinse it in a bowl of plain water to remove excess alginate . Transfer the rinsed spheres to the flavored olive oil and let them sit refrigerated for at least 12 hours (this seasons them) . To serve: Gently place each liquid olive sphere in a spoon. When eaten, the delicate membrane bursts, releasing pure olive essence. This iconic modern tapas provides a surprising liquid experience of olive with subtle herbal notes  .

Dark Chocolate Mousse with Chamomile Gelée

Chef/Source: Chantelle Nicholson – Great British Chefs  
Ingredients: Chocolate Mousse: 200g dark chocolate (dairy-free, 70%), 150ml aquafaba (chickpea water), 50g sugar, 100ml oat cream (plant cream). Chamomile Jelly: 200ml strong brewed chamomile tea, 2g agar agar (or 2 leaves bronze gelatine – but use agar for vegan), 20g sugar. Passion Fruit Sauce: Pulp of 2 passion fruits, 1 tbsp sugar. Garnish: 2 tbsp cocoa nibs, mint leaves.
Preparation: Mousse: Melt the dark chocolate gently over a bain-marie. Whip aquafaba in a mixer; as it becomes foamy, gradually add sugar and whip to a soft meringue. Fold in the melted chocolate and a splash of oat cream until combined. Chill in serving glasses. Chamomile Gel: Sweeten the brewed chamomile tea with sugar. Dissolve agar agar in the tea, bring to a boil for 1 minute. Pour into a shallow tray to set. Once firm, cut into small cubes or blend into a gel. Sauce: Simmer passion fruit pulp with sugar briefly to dissolve, chill. To serve: Top the set chocolate mousse with a spoon of passion fruit sauce and a few chamomile gel cubes or drops. Sprinkle crunchy cocoa nibs for texture . This plated dessert contrasts rich chocolate with a floral chamomile gelification and bright passion fruit. (In Nicholson’s original, aquafaba and coconut cream create the mousse, and chamomile jelly is set with agar; it demonstrates a fine-dining vegan dessert without gelatin or dairy)  .

Grapefruit “Caviar” Spheres

Chef/Source: Chef Studio  
Ingredients: 250 ml grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed and strained) , 2 g agar agar, 1 L cold vegetable oil (chilled as above) . (If grapefruit is very tart, you can dissolve 1–2 tsp sugar in the juice to balance.)
Preparation: Chill the neutral oil in a tall container in the freezer for 1–2 hours – it should be very cold but still liquid . In a pot, combine grapefruit juice and agar agar . Bring to a boil and simmer 1–2 minutes. Remove from heat. Working quickly (while the mixture is warm), use a syringe or squeeze bottle to drip the grapefruit liquid into the cold oil in a steady stream . Tiny droplets will form grapefruit gel pearls that solidify and sink in the oil . Once done, strain out the pearls and rinse them in cold water . These translucent, pale pink “caviar” spheres encapsulate bright grapefruit flavor. Use them to garnish cocktails, desserts, or salads for a burst of citrus that looks like roe. The technique demonstrates how agar can create stable pearls even with acidic juice .
