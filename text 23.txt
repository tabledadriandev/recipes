FERMENTATION 

Fermented Beetroot with Blackberries & Seaweed Oil

Chef/Source: Rob Howell – Great British Chefs  
Ingredients: Fermented beetroot: 1 kg beetroot, peeled and grated; 20 g sea salt . Roasted beetroot: 3 medium beets (additional, kept whole with skin). Pickled beetroot: 1 beet, thinly sliced; pickling liquid (100ml vinegar, 50ml water, 50g sugar, pinch salt). Seaweed oil: 100ml rapeseed oil, 5g dried seaweed (dulse or kelp). Garnish: Handful of blackberries, 50g hazelnuts (toasted, crushed), fresh herbs.
Preparation: Ferment Beetroot: Mix grated beetroot with 2% salt (20g salt per 1kg beet) . Pack tightly in a jar, weigh it down, and seal. Ferment at room temp for ~5–7 days until tangy (burp daily). Once fermented, it will have natural sweetness and tang . Seaweed Oil: Blend neutral oil with dried seaweed; warm gently, then let infuse 1 hour. Strain to get a green, savory oil. Roast Beets: Roast whole beetroots in foil at 180°C until tender; peel and cut into chunks. Pickle Slices: Blanch thin beet slices in pickling liquid, cool. Assembly: In a bowl, mix fermented grated beet with some roasted beet chunks and a few fresh or lightly cooked blackberries, and crushed hazelnuts – this is the beet “salad”. Drizzle with seaweed-infused oil for a hint of ocean brine. Plate the mixture and dot with pickled beet slices and more blackberries. This stunning dish combines fermented beetroot (for depth of flavor) with sweet elements and crunchy nuts, balanced by the unique umami of seaweed oil  .

Fermented Garlic Cloves (2-Week Black Garlic Shortcut)

Chef/Source: GBC Kitchen – Great British Chefs  
Ingredients: 80g garlic cloves (about 2 bulbs worth), peeled ; 3g fine sea salt; ~100ml water (non-chlorinated) . (This makes a small jar; scale up as needed with the same 3% salt brine ratio.)
Preparation: Pack the peeled garlic cloves into a sterilized jar . Dissolve 3g salt in 100ml water (3% brine). Pour brine over the garlic to fully submerge the cloves . Place a piece of greaseproof paper or a fermentation weight on top to keep garlic under the liquid . Seal the jar. Keep at room temperature away from direct light. For the first week or so, “burp” the jar daily to release gases . Ferment for 14 days at room temp. Over time, the garlic will develop a slight fizz and tang (like mild kimchi)  . After 2 weeks, taste a clove – it should have a mellow, tangy flavor with amplified umami, while still retaining garlic’s sweetness. Once happy with the flavor, transfer the jar to the fridge to slow fermentation . Uses: These fermented garlic cloves can be chopped into dressings, blitzed into sauces or hummus, or used whole in sautés. Fermenting “amplifies the umami” of garlic, contributing a savory depth that’s especially valuable in vegan cooking (evoking some of the complexity of black garlic in a shorter time)  . The cloves can last 6 months refrigerated in brine.

Lacto-Fermented Tomato Salsa

Chef/Source: Great British Chefs (GBC Kitchen) 
Ingredients: 200g ripe tomatoes, chopped; 3/4 oz (20g) flaky sea salt ; 1 thumb-sized piece ginger, grated; 4 tbsp raw apple cider vinegar; 1 clove garlic, minced; 1 red chili, chopped. (Note: Original includes honey, but replace with 1 tsp sugar for vegan.)
Preparation: Combine chopped tomatoes, ginger, garlic, chili. Add sea salt (about 3% by weight) and toss – this will start fermentation by drawing out juices . Pack into a jar loosely covered with cloth. Let sit at room temp for 2–3 days, stirring daily, until it lightly ferments (you’ll see bubbles). After fermenting, stir in apple cider vinegar (and a touch of sugar to replace honey) to stop fermentation and add tang. This creates a fermented tomato salsa with a fresh but funky flavor. Use as a condiment on tacos, grains, or salads.
